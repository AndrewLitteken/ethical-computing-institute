## “Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.”
### ― Immanuel Kant, *Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals*

### Statement of Purpose
#### What makes an action ethical?
Deontological ethics is based on the the theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether or not that action itself is right or wrong and not look at the consequence of the action. This type of ethics is commonly referred to as 'duty' based ethics as it binds a person to the set of rules they follow that determine the morality of their actions.

Immanuel Kant is often considered one of the first philosophers to touch on this ethical framework. To determine if an action was ethical, Kant says the only thing that is important is the will of the person doing the action. If the person was acting in good will and doing what is within their duty, they are acting ethically. Deontology is in contrast to consequentialist ethics, which only cares about the end results of an action regardless of the steps to get there. Deontology instead is action-based and focuses on the morality of actions a person commits.

#### What triggers the need to evaluate an action?
Every action someone does while following the Deontological ethic framework triggers the need to evaluate that action. Kant describes the **categorical imperative** as the basis of evaluation. This states 'Act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by thy will a universal law of nature.' What this means is that if you are willing for everyone in the world to adopt the action you are about to do, then you are acting ethically, and if not, then you are acting unethically. This exists as a personal way of checking the morality of an action that you are about to take.

#### Predisposition to act in accordance to Deontological ethics
In many ways people have the predisposition to act in accordance to Deontological Ethics. Many people will often evaluate whether a specific action is ethical or not before doing it and determine if they want to continue with that action. However, many people have a greater focus on the consequence of actions and look to the future to see what an action may result in. A common example is if a murderer were to ask you where a friend of yours is located. Deontological ethics says that you must tell the truth even if it would result in the harm of your friend, as lying is unethical. This is a way that many people are not predisposed to act and thus would require more awareness to act in accordance with Deontology.

#### Three issues in computer technology
1. **Whistle blowing** in computer science is something that Deontological ethics would be in support of. In the view of this framework, by having knowledge of something that should be known to all, it would be unethical to hide that from the global community. It is for the larger good to whistleblow and release the information, and thus is the duty of the deontologist. We can also consider a case in which an employee is being asked about the ongoings of the company they work for. In this case the developer must be honest with their answers as lying would be an unethical action within the framework, even if it results in negative outcomes for the company.

2. Deontologists would have a lot to say on  **Piracy**. The action of downloading illegally obtained media would absolutely be considered wrong and unethical within the framework. Downloading this data would essentially be theft and regardless of what the data might be used for, it is against the morals of deontology to obtain the data in this manner.

3. **Hacking** is a field that deontologists would be morally against. Even if that hacking is white-hat and with good intent, that action of breaching a system's defenses or finding an exploit would be considered unethical. The end goal of the hack are not of concern to the deontologist, only the specific actions involved.



### ACM Code:
There is a section on avoiding harm which states “When harm is an intentional part of the system, those responsible are obligated to ensure that the harm is ethically justified.” We think this goes well with Deontology as the main goal of Deontology is to have moral actions are considered more than the consequence. The ACM code emphasizes the need to minimize harm unless there is a compelling ethical reason to do otherwise. This could relate to saving the life of a family member in exchange for driving terrorists somewhere- which was an example we read about in our framework. The ACM has strict rules but realizes there might be times when it is necessary to bend the rules. Section 2.3 further explains this as it states that professionals must abide by laws and regulations unless faced with a compelling ethical reason not to.
In the ACM code, there is a section about fostering public awareness and understanding about technologies or communicating with the public good. Kant would argue that in Deontology, giving back to the community is unnecessary. He stated that giving a large amount of your paycheck to relieve a lot of the poor was not important and if you want to go see a concert or eat an expensive meal, that was okay and up to you. The code also stresses that professionals should be fair and take action not to discriminate. Deontology differs in that it is okay to put your loved one’s life above a stranger’s life. 

We would say that our framework of Deontology adds specific examples as to when it is and when it is not acceptable to bend the rules of morality and that could add something to this code. Examples of typical situations professionals might be presented with and guidelines for what to do would be beneficial.

### IEEE Code of Ethics:
In a deontological ethical framework, an ethical person must ensure that his or her actions are consistent with some set of rules dictating good actions and bad actions. Likewise, the IEEE Code of Ethics is largely action-based and rule-based. It consists of a list of rules that IEEE members must comply with, detailing both actions that members should strive to perform (duties and obligations) and those they should avoid. For example, members are called to “reject bribery in all its forms” and “to treat fairly all persons…”.
However, the IEEE Code of Ethics could not likely be considered a fully deontological ethical framework, since some of the guidelines listed cannot be considered purely action-based. In a deontological system, only the action is considered in determining morality, and this is done so in accordance with a set of rules. No time is spent considering the consequences of one’s action, so one should be able to recall the set of rules and quickly determine whether an action is right or wrong. However, rules such as the first (“to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public, to strive to comply with ethical design and sustainable development practices, and to disclose promptly factors that might endanger the public or the environment;”) are vague. While this could technically be considered action-based, since “to hold paramount” is an action verb, the specifics of the actions one must undertake to do so are dependent upon the consequences that the guideline spells out—that is, the “safety, health, and welfare of the public”. One must consider: What exactly is the safety, health, and welfare of the public? Is it the most good for all people? This guideline requires nearly utilitarian analysis.
	The IEEE Code of Ethics is largely consistent with deontological ethics. However, it could further benefit from aspects of deontological frameworks through added specificity in the ethical and unethical actions outlined in the guidelines. For example, the first guideline (“to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public…”) could be supplemented by the addition of specific ways in which to accomplish this, such as “to never intentionally obscure legal information from a user.” While this may seem an obvious transgression under the existing Code of Ethics, a member could still potentially justify this action due to the code’s ambiguity.

### ICCP:
The ICCP Code of Ethics certainly contains elements of a deontological ethical framework. The most obvious of these is a list of guidelines dictating proper and improper behavior for an ICCP professional. These guidelines consist of action-based imperatives such as “Be honest and trustworthy” and “Respect privacy”, consistent with deontological ethics’ emphasis on action rather than consequences.
	However, the ICCP’s Code of Ethics is highly contingent upon the consideration of the “public good” in determining the morality of one’s actions. It states in its preamble: “Questions related to these kinds of issues can best be answered by thoughtful consideration of the fundamental ethical principles, understanding that the public good is the paramount consideration.” In other words, an ICCP member must consider whether the consequences of his or her actions will result in the greatest public good to determine whether or not his or her actions are moral. This is incompatible with the deontological framework, which requires that only the actions (regardless of consequences) be considered in determining morality. Additionally, the guidelines presented in Section 1 (General Ethical Principles) suffer from the same problem as some of the guidelines in the IEEE Code of Ethics. While these guidelines might technically contain an action, the action is intentionally vague since there are many possibilities as to how to go about performing it, and the morally correct way is dependent upon the consequences of that action as specified in the guideline. For example, one of these guidelines is “Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.” Adhering to this guideline requires that one consider whether one’s actions will result in a contribution to human well-being. This is incompatible with the deontological ethical framework because it requires consideration of consequences rather than purely the action.
	One thing that the ICCP Code of Ethics could potentially gain from a deontological perspective is a more thorough list of unethical practices, an example being “sharing someone’s information without their consent”. One of the potential drawbacks of ethical frameworks that focus upon consequences rather than actions is that immoral actions could be justified in favor of a positive consequence. While it has its own set of drawbacks that must be considered, a deontological framework prevents this by prohibiting and mandating certain actions regardless of outcome.
