## “Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.”
### ― Immanuel Kant, *Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals*

### Statement of Purpose
#### What makes an action ethical?
Deontological ethics is based on the the theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether or not that action itself is right or wrong and not look at the consequence of the action. This type of ethics is commonly referred to as 'duty' based ethics as it binds a person to the set of rules they follow that determine the morality of their actions.

Immanuel Kant is often considered one of the first philosophers to touch on this ethical framework. To determine if an action was ethical, Kant says the only thing that is important is the will of the person doing the action. If the person was acting in good will and doing what is within their duty, they are acting ethically. Deontology is in contrast to consequentialist ethics, which only cares about the end results of an action regardless of the steps to get there. Deontology instead is action-based and focuses on the morality of actions a person commits.

#### What triggers the need to evaluate an action?
Every action someone does while following the Deontological ethic framework triggers the need to evaluate that action. Kant describes the **categorical imperative** as the basis of evaluation. This states 'Act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by thy will a universal law of nature.' What this means is that if you are willing for everyone in the world to adopt the action you are about to do, then you are acting ethically, and if not, then you are acting unethically. This exists as a personal way of checking the morality of an action that you are about to take.

#### Predisposition to act in accordance to Deontological ethics
In many ways people have the predisposition to act in accordance to Deontological Ethics. Many people will often evaluate whether a specific action is ethical or not before doing it and determine if they want to continue with that action. However, many people have a greater focus on the consequence of actions and look to the future to see what an action may result in. A common example is if a murderer were to ask you where a friend of yours is located. Deontological ethics says that you must tell the truth even if it would result in the harm of your friend, as lying is unethical. This is a way that many people are not predisposed to act and thus would require more awareness to act in accordance with Deontology.

#### Three issues in computer technology
1. **Whistle blowing** in computer science is something that Deontological ethics would be in support of. In the view of this framework, by having knowledge of something that should be known to all, it would be unethical to hide that from the global community. It is for the larger good to whistleblow and release the information, and thus is the duty of the deontologist. We can also consider a case in which an employee is being asked about the ongoings of the company they work for. In this case the developer must be honest with their answers as lying would be an unethical action within the framework, even if it results in negative outcomes for the company.

2. Deontologists would have a lot to say on  **Piracy**. The action of downloading illegally obtained media would absolutely be considered wrong and unethical within the framework. Downloading this data would essentially be theft and regardless of what the data might be used for, it is against the morals of deontology to obtain the data in this manner.

3. **Hacking** is a field that deontologists would be morally against. Even if that hacking is white-hat and with good intent, that action of breaching a system's defenses or finding an exploit would be considered unethical. The end goal of the hack are not of concern to the deontologist, only the specific actions involved.



### ACM Code:
There is a section on avoiding harm which states “When harm is an intentional part of the system, those responsible are obligated to ensure that the harm is ethically justified.” We think this goes well with Deontology as the main goal of Deontology is to have moral actions are considered more than the consequence. The ACM code emphasizes the need to minimize harm unless there is a compelling ethical reason to do otherwise. This could relate to saving the life of a family member in exchange for driving terrorists somewhere- which was an example we read about in our framework. The ACM has strict rules but realizes there might be times when it is necessary to bend the rules. Section 2.3 further explains this as it states that professionals must abide by laws and regulations unless faced with a compelling ethical reason not to.
In the ACM code, there is a section about fostering public awareness and understanding about technologies or communicating with the public good. Kant would argue that in Deontology, giving back to the community is unnecessary. He stated that giving a large amount of your paycheck to relieve a lot of the poor was not important and if you want to go see a concert or eat an expensive meal, that was okay and up to you. The code also stresses that professionals should be fair and take action not to discriminate. Deontology differs in that it is okay to put your loved one’s life above a stranger’s life.

We would say that our framework of Deontology adds specific examples as to when it is and when it is not acceptable to bend the rules of morality and that could add something to this code. Examples of typical situations professionals might be presented with and guidelines for what to do would be beneficial.

### IEEE Code of Ethics:
In a deontological ethical framework, an ethical person must ensure that his or her actions are consistent with some set of rules dictating good actions and bad actions. Likewise, the IEEE Code of Ethics is largely action-based and rule-based. It consists of a list of rules that IEEE members must comply with, detailing both actions that members should strive to perform (duties and obligations) and those they should avoid. For example, members are called to “reject bribery in all its forms” and “to treat fairly all persons…”.

However, the IEEE Code of Ethics could not likely be considered a fully deontological ethical framework, since some of the guidelines listed cannot be considered purely action-based. In a deontological system, only the action is considered in determining morality, and this is done so in accordance with a set of rules. No time is spent considering the consequences of one’s action, so one should be able to recall the set of rules and quickly determine whether an action is right or wrong. However, rules such as the first (“to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public, to strive to comply with ethical design and sustainable development practices, and to disclose promptly factors that might endanger the public or the environment;”) are vague. While this could technically be considered action-based, since “to hold paramount” is an action verb, the specifics of the actions one must undertake to do so are dependent upon the consequences that the guideline spells out—that is, the “safety, health, and welfare of the public”. One must consider: What exactly is the safety, health, and welfare of the public? Is it the most good for all people? This guideline requires nearly utilitarian analysis.

The IEEE Code of Ethics is largely consistent with deontological ethics. However, it could further benefit from aspects of deontological frameworks through added specificity in the ethical and unethical actions outlined in the guidelines. For example, the first guideline (“to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public…”) could be supplemented by the addition of specific ways in which to accomplish this, such as “to never intentionally obscure legal information from a user.” While this may seem an obvious transgression under the existing Code of Ethics, a member could still potentially justify this action due to the code’s ambiguity.

### ICCP:
The ICCP Code of Ethics certainly contains elements of a deontological ethical framework. The most obvious of these is a list of guidelines dictating proper and improper behavior for an ICCP professional. These guidelines consist of action-based imperatives such as “Be honest and trustworthy” and “Respect privacy”, consistent with deontological ethics’ emphasis on action rather than consequences.

However, the ICCP’s Code of Ethics is highly contingent upon the consideration of the “public good” in determining the morality of one’s actions. It states in its preamble: “Questions related to these kinds of issues can best be answered by thoughtful consideration of the fundamental ethical principles, understanding that the public good is the paramount consideration.” In other words, an ICCP member must consider whether the consequences of his or her actions will result in the greatest public good to determine whether or not his or her actions are moral. This is incompatible with the deontological framework, which requires that only the actions (regardless of consequences) be considered in determining morality.

Additionally, the guidelines presented in Section 1 (General Ethical Principles) suffer from the same problem as some of the guidelines in the IEEE Code of Ethics. While these guidelines might technically contain an action, the action is intentionally vague since there are many possibilities as to how to go about performing it, and the morally correct way is dependent upon the consequences of that action as specified in the guideline. For example, one of these guidelines is “Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.” Adhering to this guideline requires that one consider whether one’s actions will result in a contribution to human well-being. This is incompatible with the deontological ethical framework because it requires consideration of consequences rather than purely the action.
One thing that the ICCP Code of Ethics could potentially gain from a deontological perspective is a more thorough list of unethical practices, an example being “sharing someone’s information without their consent”. One of the potential drawbacks of ethical frameworks that focus upon consequences rather than actions is that immoral actions could be justified in favor of a positive consequence. While it has its own set of drawbacks that must be considered, a deontological framework prevents this by prohibiting and mandating certain actions regardless of outcome.

### Analyzing H-1B
The H-1B visa system allows for workers from all different countries to obtain part-time legal residency in the United States. However, these workers must be skilled and working in jobs that require at least a bachelor’s degree of the foreign equivalent. Although it is the largest guest worker program in the United States, this system is very controversial, and President Trump signed an executive order that puts increased pressure on the program and its effects on U.S. citizens.

Despite the controversy surrounding H-1B visas, there are definite positives associated with the program. One of the most obvious goods associated with this program is that it affords skilled workers from other countries the ability to work and live in the United States. The program includes workers from any country, which contrasts with visas such as the TN visa program that includes only Canadians and Mexicans. This gives foreign workers access to companies and jobs that may not exist in their native countries. The direct corollary accessing these jobs is often a higher standard of living, as some of the jobs are relatively high paying. Another positive is the effect that these workers can have on the U.S. economy. Many of these workers have highly valued technical skills and Silicon Valley tech companies are willing to pay salaries of well over $130,000 in order to bring these workers to their firm. This led to further development in the tech industry. Another aspect of the H-1B visa that foreign workers find attractive is that spouses and children are also welcome to stay in the United States while the visa holder is working. This is under a different visa called the H-4, which has its own employment opportunities and rules. Lastly, the H-1B program is something called a dual intent visa. This means that a programmer hired from India who is currently working at Apple has the opportunity to apply for legal permanent residency in the United States.

Unfortunately many of the pros listed above are negated by flaws within the H-1B program. One major example of this is the large numbers of visas that are taken by outsourcing and consulting companies. The sad reality as that most of these firms pay their foreign workers lower salaries than United Citizens. So even though it is possible for foreign workers to get an Apple or Google job paying over six figures, it is much more common to get a job at Wipro or Infosys paying half of that. This hurts both the foreign and the domestic workers. The foreign workers are making less than their American counterparts for the same job, and domestic workers are losing jobs to cheaper H-1B visa labor. Another complication associated with the H-1B program is the long wait time for permanent legal residency. In Bloomberg reading, a worker on the H-1B visa claimed that his green card waiting process could take ten to twenty years. This leaves many workers in limbo because the program is only three years, which is obviously not long enough unless the worker is able to extend it. This extension is certainly not a guarantee. Some of the other disadvantages of the program are logistical. The number of applicants for the H-1B visa is massive, but there are only a limited number of spots. A lottery decides who gets the visa, but over 100,000 applicants are out of luck. The firms also face some costs for foreign workers, as the visa can cost a firm up to $7,700 dollars. These cons and more that are not listed have led to much scrutinization of the H-1B program.

Approaching the controversies associated with the H-1B program from a deontological point of view can help to determine what is moral with the program and what is immoral. The most important things to remember about the Deontological ethics framework is that it is an actions-based framework that does not care about consequences and that it is founded on the categorical imperative. The categorical imperative states that the morality of an action can be determined by asking if you would want everyone else to perform the same action. By utilizing this framework, the overall morality of the H-1B visa system can be assessed by applying the categorical imperative to the various actions of those involved. In this instance the decision-making parties would be the foreign worker hoping to obtain the H-1B visa, the company where the foreign worker is planning to work, and the government that puts the program into effect.

The action of the worker is the clearest under the deontological framework. The worker is attempting to better their life by applying for a job and a living permit in a foreign country. A deontologist would argue that this is moral based on the categorical imperative. There seems to be no apparent situation in which the actual action of searching out opportunities for one’s best interest would be disagreed with. That is not to say that there are not unforeseen consequences, such as an American worker who is replaced, but these are consequences that do not make the action itself immoral. In fact, a deontologist would likely reason that unfortunate consequences in the H-1B visa case such as these stem from immoral actions by somebody else.

In this instance that somebody else would be the multitude of firms that accept workers with H-1B visas but fail to accommodate them fairly. This is exactly what the IEAA-USA article claims outsourcing and consulting firms do. These firms do not have to pay the foreign workers as much as domestic workers. As a result, foreign workers are not paid enough, and American workers are left out of the workplace. In the Deontological framework, it is easy to see that the actions of the company to maximize profits by undercutting worker compensation. The reason for this is because the company executives would certainly not want their compensation lowered to unfair and uncompetitive values.

The morality of the government is most easily assessed when looking at the action of setting up the H-1B program. A deontologist would likely argue that the action itself is moral because the government is simply attempting to maximize the welfare of its citizens. This is something that would be universally accepted. Once again there are unforeseen consequences (caused by employers and other natural reasons such as a large number of applicants) that should be addressed, and that seems to be the direction that legislators and lobbyists are attempting to do just that in an attempt to further make decisions based on the welfare of its citizens.

### Discussing the Google Memo
The Google internal memo touched on diversity programs within Google and how they are discriminatory. The memo tries to paint a picture where the lack of diversity in terms of gender is not a result of bias and discrimination in the workplace but rather a result of traits that are innate to men and women (Biological Differences). The author of the memo argues that these differences are not socially constructed because of the universality across cultures, the presence of biological causes and so on. The author then goes into how these differences result in different desires and personalities between men and women which eventually lead to the gender gap we have. The author then goes to suggest what he calls non-discriminatory ways to reduce the gender gap which are based on the biological differences he highlights. One example of these suggested measures is making software engineering more people-oriented by using pair programming and making it more collaborative so that women, who have a higher interest in people, can thrive.  

A deontologist would argue that it is immoral to have gender or racial discrimination with in the tech industry. The memo makes suggestions or criticizes existing google initiatives that are trying to fix this gender and racial discrimination or disparity. At face value the “Anti-Diversity” manifesto is not immoral for merely making suggestions about existing policies we have to further look into each suggestion and how they relate to the categorical imperative. The first harm of Google’s biases that the author presents is programs and resources for people with a certain gender or race.  This would be considered immoral by a deontologist as it goes against the categorical imperative as it cannot be made universal. The policy should allow universal accessibility for those who would want to participate and need these resources regardless of their gender or race. Similarly having a high priority queue and special treatment for “diversity” candidates would be immoral under deontological ethics for the same reasoning given above. In fact, most of the suggested harms of Google's current policy would be immoral as they would favor a certain group (Women and Ethnic minorities) over others. Deontological ethics only looks at the action itself and not the resulting diversity or good and thus would consider Google’s policy immoral.  The author makes what he calls “Non-discriminatory” ways to reduce the gender gap. From a deontological perspective these would have no moral harm, but this would depend on the premises the author outlines about women and men being true. If the premises are false, then the suggestions would be based on a lie and be morally harmful. The deontological framework would consider wanting more diversity as moral because it does not go against the categorical imperative. But the hard part would be coming up with ways that lead to diversity without going against the categorical imperative.

### Gender Bias in Tech
The disparity between women and men in technology has been an issue ever since the age of modern technology began to take shape. From the early computer programmers at MIT to Silicon Valley today, there have always been less women than men in technology. While there are a lot of opinions and theories around why this is the case, the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) has made it clear that this issue is not one that deals with women’s innate behaviors. The NCWIT has pointed out three main problems with society’s stigma against women in technology which are: 1) Misunderstanding the research on brain differences (between women and men), 2) Misunderstanding the research on gender differences in interests or aspirations, and 3) Misunderstanding the nature of computing, engineering, or work in general.

The first point about brain research that the NCWIT is making is essentially highlighting the fact that there are no “hardwired” differences between the brains of women and men. There is no biological evidence supporting the differences between men and women. The second point is pointing out that there are no innate desires within women that dissuade them from pursuing a career in technology. In fact, one of the main reasons why women do not pursue a career in technology is due to social pressures and stigmas that women do not belong in technology. Finally the third point that the NCWIT is making is that engineering is not about building things or is a debate of technician versus artist as many people think. Engineering is about the art of problem solving and cooperation with each other, which people from all backgrounds can succeed in.

A deontologist would argue that the lack of women in technology is immoral and that there should be a greater level of gender diversity within technology. The pure act of gender discrimination is innately immoral and goes against the categorical imperative -- discriminating in itself is inherently bad. When it comes to the three issues that the NCWIT presented, a deontologist would support the NCWIT through these issues and would further agree to fixing the gender differences that exist in technology. For the first issue, there is not much correlation between science and deontologists. However, fully understanding any issue and educating oneself would be moral. In this case, one could say that those trying to make the argument that women’s brains are simply different from men’s brains is not making an informed argument, and therefore is going against our ethical framework. Moving on to the second issue of the innate desires and aspirations of women, a deontologist would argue that the social pressures that exist that cause these misunderstandings are not good for the world. Women should do whatever they want to do and they should not have any negative influences or pressures preventing them. The virtues of allowing equal opportunity without negativity is universally good and moral. Additionally, providing greater gender diversity promotes problem solving, innovation, and decision making according to the NCWIT. Although a deontologist may say that these are consequences of promoting women in technology and not actual actions -- they are actions in themselves and certainly moral actions according to the categorical imperative. Finally, the misunderstanding of the engineering field and work in general would fall under similar evaluation to the NCWIT’s first point -- making an uninformed judgement on women in technology is immoral according to a deontologist. Understanding the engineering field and what it really is would help promote women in technology which is a positive action that falls under the categorical imperative. In summary, from a deontological view, promoting women in technology and eliminating the gender gap is moral, the right thing to do, and is something that could be universally applied. Giving opportunities to those who are underprivileged is a virtuous action.

### Race and Ethnicity Biases
“[Silicon Valley] wants to do these things, but nobody is making the solid commitments,” said Howard University’s Computer Science Department Chair, Legand Burge in a Bloomberg piece reporting the struggle to get African American programmers into the elite tech bubble in California. What’s gone wrong? To begin with, the computer science pipeline is broken all the way down towards grade school and secondary education which puts minority computer science students behind the curve when they arrive on a college campus. Students from Howard University who were interviewed for the Bloomberg article noted that their computer science experience started in college; there were no coding classes or hackathons available to them in high school. This puts these students at a preparedness disadvantage compared to white students from coastal biospheres where early education has a focus on tech. Without these early experiences to put on their resume, minority college students often lose out on early college internships which continues to stifle their tech employment prospects.

Part of this broken pipeline is not just educational, but cultural as well. The “Hollywood Hacker” is hardly ever portrayed as a minority individual from a representative background, but usually as a white nerd from a well-to-do suburb. Minority students are being turned off from tech at this young age when they are stereotyped out of fitting some sort of programmer mold.

For minority college students who resolve to complete a computer science education despite these early factors working against them, they are now forced to contend with a tech culture that has, for decades, been saturated with white culture alone. This creates a minority retention problem for computer science. As students come into universities and don’t see anyone like themselves in their classes and computer science cohorts, it can be alienating and foster doubt that this student should be in the program in the first place. This cultural alienation can have consequences for companies too. How could we expect a minority student to see themselves being successful at a company that is dominated by white culture.

A minority programmer might feel out of place in a computer science program or workplace, but that is the less sinister byproduct of the whiteness of computer science culture. More problematically, companies that have been hiring white employees for decades have set the standard for what workplace culture is like, and it’s predominantly white. Legand Burge explains, ““Back in the civil rights period, it used to be that lighter-skinned people were able to pass and be more acceptable, so they were able to get into organizations or get into companies. Now it’s a little bit different. It’s about cultural fit. Do you laugh at the same jokes? Do you Rollerblade or whatever?” These tech companies have developed an implicit bias against hiring minorities because they don’t necessarily fit in with the white lifestyle culture that has come to dominate the industry.

As deontologists we commend the work that technology companies have already started to bridge the gap for minority computer scientists who might be starting late in their education or who don’t see a fit for themselves in this workplace or culture. The Google “Engineer in Residence” program that helped re-envision the Howard University curriculum is one such step. However, upon realizing that it is not enough to simply equip minorities with knowledge, it is imperative we do more to change the unconscious bias in the computer science culture. Universities and companies should endeavor to expose minority students to programming in high school by offering sustained encouragement to the subject, rather than fleeting, one day at a time efforts. Additionally, it would be virtuous if these organizations set out to redefine the perceived culture of computer science by not making the existing one a standard for entry since it bars others from inclusion.

### Comparison of Potential Solutions to an Ethical Issue
A large ethical problem that many industries are facing, especially the tech industry, is the potential monopolies that the largest corporations have over important and lucrative markets. This problem leads to an anticompetitive nature of the industry and prevents innovation from happening at the start up level. When a company has the power to control an entire market by either purchasing a company or pushing others out of the market, it prevents competition and growth of the industry. Two solutions have been proposed to solve this problem and reduce the anti-competitive practices within the tech industry. The first is simply preventing monopolies from the start by limiting the acquisitions that can be made, and the second is regulating the product theft and price undercutting from tech giants like Amazon and Google.

Preventing monopolies from existing can be done by restricting the type of acquisitions a company can make. This can be accomplished with regulations set by the government. Back in 1968 if a company had over 15% market share, then they were not allowed to acquire a company larger than 3% market share. This prevents one company from ballooning and taking over an industry. By limiting the size of a company that a major tech giant can purchase, then they can no longer buy out all competition and integrate the smaller companies into their own.

A large problem contributing to the monopoly issue in the tech industry is the capital that is behind the largest companies. Companies like Amazon have the ability to take a good selling item on their platform, create their own version, and sell it at a much cheaper price eventually pushing the original product out of the way. They can control what items are show first within the search and insure that their product is being purchased. By regulating this behavior in terms of price cuts and search result rankings, this type of behavior can be prevented and shut down.

Both of these methods can be effective in controlling the size of the tech giants. The way in which a company like Google or Amazon displays search results and preventing the steep price cuts these companies can make would be easy to implement and control as well as being an effective way to allow new and small companies to rise up and have a fair shot at growing themselves. Without the fear of an idea being stolen and resold for cheaper, smaller developers can innovate, creating new products. By not permitting companies to always display their own products first, it would more organically allow smaller companies to gain a foothold in the industry and get their ideas or products out there. This solution provides an effective and simple way to ensure that all companies have a chance and would require some way to monitor the ranking algorithms a search would use.

 However, by implementing this it would still be possible for a large company to just buy these new innovative company and take their product that way. By preventing this type of acquisitions, it would further help smaller startups have confidence in their own products and give them time to grow into a competition for the larger companies. It would leave the door open for more competition because overall there will be more players within a market creating their own products and innovating within the industry. It would require some type of limitation on either the size of a company being acquired in terms of market share or the number of companies that one can acquire.

In reality it would be most effective to implement both solutions as by themselves they will not be wholly effective. If both solutions are implement then the playing field within a market will be much more balanced and all players would have fair opportunity to grow and develop. Both solutions leave alternative methods that would allow a company to create a monopoly so individually they are rather useless and wouldn’t solve the greater problem. If the giant can’t buy a company then they can just force them out of the market, and likewise if they can’t force them out of the market, they will just buy the smaller startup so a much better solution would be to merge these two solutions together for the most anti-competitive protection.

In terms of Deontological ethics, it would say that the solution of regulating search engines and price cutting would be a more ethical solution to the problem. Deontology is an action-based ethics and it would say that the action of providing biased and inaccurate data in terms of search result, both in a general search engine as well as product search, would be considered unethical. Therefore, deontologist would want to have a way to regulate this type of behavior and not permit the ability to modify the results in this way. If a deontologist was in charge of one of these tech giants, then they would not want to undercut a smaller company and steal their product regardless of whether or not it would lead to more profit. They would only look at the specific action of taking the product idea and making it themselves and ask if they would want that action to be done by all in the world (the categorical imperative) and decide that it would not be morally right. Therefore, this solution would be a more favorable one to solve this aspect of corporate unethical behavior. Also, it is worth considering if the solution itself is ethical and in this case the action of regulating prices would be considered a morally fine action.
