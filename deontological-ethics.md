## “Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.”
### ― Immanuel Kant, *Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals*

#### What makes an action ethical?
Deontological ethics is based on the the theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether or no that action itself is right or wrong and not look at the consequence of the action. This type of ethics is commonly referred to as 'duty' based ethics as it binds a person to the set of rules they follow that determine the morality of their actions.

Immanuel Kant is often considered on of the first philosophers to touch on this ethical framework. To determine if an action was ethical, Kant says the only thing that is important is the will of the person doing the action. If the person was acting in good will and doing what is within their duty, they are acting ethically. Deontology is in contrast to consequentialist ethics, which only cares about the end results of an action regardless of the steps to get there. Deontology instead is action-based and the morality of actions a person commits.

#### What triggers the need to evaluate an action?
Every action someone does while following the Deontological ethic framework triggers the need to evaluate that action. Kant describes the **categorical imperative** as the basis of evaluation. This states 'Act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by thy will a universal law of nature.' What this means is that if you are willing for everyone in the world to adopt the action you are about to do, then you are acting ethically, and if not, then you are acting unethically. This exists as a personal way of checking the morality of an action that you are about to take.

#### Predisposition to act in accordance to Deontological ethics
In many ways people have the predisposition to act in accordance to Deontological Ethics. Many people will often evaluate whether a specific action is ethical or not before doing it and determine if they want to continue with that action. However, many people have a greater focus on the consequence of actions and look to the future to see what an action may result in. A common example is if a murderer were to ask you where a friend of yours is located. Deontological ethics says that you must tell the truth even if it would result in the harm of your friend, as lying is unethical. This is a way that many people are not predisposed to act and thus would require more awareness to act in accordance with Deontology.

#### Three issues in computer technology
1. **Whistle blowing** in computer science is something that Deontological ethics would be in support of. In the view of this framework, by having knowledge of something that should be known to all, it would be unethical to hide that from the global community. It is for the larger good to whistleblow and release the information, and thus is the duty of the deontologist. We can also consider a case in which an employee is being asked about the ongoings of the company they work for. In this case the developer must be honest with their answers as lying would be an unethical action within the framework, even if it results in negative outcomes for the company.

2. Deontologists would have a lot to say on  **Piracy**. The action of downloading illegally obtained media would absolutely be considered wrong and unethical within the framework. Downloading this data would essentially be theft and regardless of what the data might be used for, it is against the morals of deontology to obtain the data in this manner.

3. **Hacking** is a field that deontologists would be morally against. Even if that hacking is white-hat and with good intent, that action of breaching a system's defenses or finding an exploit would be considered unethical. The end goal of the hack are not of concern to the deontologist, only the specific actions involved.



# ACM Code:
There is a section on avoiding harm which states “When harm is an intentional part of the system, those responsible are obligated to ensure that the harm is ethically justified.” I think this goes well with Deontology as the main goal of Deontology is to have moral actions are considered more than the consequence. The ACM code emphasizes the need to minimize harm unless there is a compelling ethical reason to do otherwise. This could relate to saving the life of a family member in exchange for driving terrorists somewhere- which was an example we read about in our framework. The ACM has strict rules but realizes there might be times when it is necessary to bend the rules. Section 2.3 further explains this as it states that professionals must abide by laws and regulations unless faced with a compelling ethical reason not to.
 n the ACM code, there is a section about fostering public awareness and understanding about technologies or communicating with the public good. Kant would argue that in Deontology, giving back to the community is unnecessary. He stated that giving a large amount of your paycheck to relieve a lot of the poor was not important and if you want to go see a concert or eat an expensive meal, that was okay and up to you. The code also stresses that professionals should be fair and take action not to discriminate. Deontology differs in that it is okay to put your loved one’s life above a stranger’s life. 

I would say that our framework of Deontology adds specific examples as to when it is and when it is not acceptable to bend the rules of morality and that could add something to this code. Examples of typical situations professionals might be presented with and guidelines for what to do would be beneficial.
