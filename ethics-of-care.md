## “Caring requires paying attention, seeing, listening, responding with respect. Its logic is contextual, psychological. Care is a relational ethic, grounded in a premise of interdependence. But it is not selfless.”
### ― Carol Gilligan, *Joining the Resistance*

## Statement Of Purpose

### What Makes An Action Ethical According to the Ethics of Care?

To evaluate actions with the Ethics of Care framework, one must look at how the action affects the person performing the action and the people that are being cared for by that person. If an action ignores the well-being of either of those two parties, it is unethical. However, if both parties’ interests are met, the action is ethical. Furthermore, the relationships that are impacted by the action should be evaluated. In the framework, relationships are between unequal parties. For example, a parent and a child. Because one’s moral development is defined by the relationships that they are involved in, actions that sever relationships are unethical and actions that strengthen relationships are ethical. In summation, the Ethics of Care framework emphasizes maintaining and strengthening connections to others, as well as protecting the interests of those involved, as a collective unit.

### What triggers the need to evaluate how ethical an action is?

With the framework of Care Ethics in mind, actions must be evaluated for how ethical they are when these actions impact those we care about or are connected to. The Ethics of Care emphasizes the connections to others and maintaining those connections, as well as protecting the interests of those involved, as a collective unit. When making decisions that affect others, we must be mindful of how ethical our decision will be. In this way when some action impacts a relationship between any two parties the ethics of care would ask one to step in and evalute how ethical the action is. This can be many different kinds of relationships including by not limited to: company and customer, employer and developer, and developer and customer.  


### What predisposition do people have to act ethically according to the Ethics of Care?

According to the ethics of care, the predisposition people have to act ethically is influenced by gender. Men are predisposed to act in an ethical manner according to abstract ideas of justice and duty, whereas women act ethically according to ideas of empathy and compassion. Because ethics and what one deems to be ethical is rooted in a moral system, men and women are predisposed to acting ethically with regard to their respective moral systems.  This idea is essential to the ethics of care as its founder, Carol Gilligan, sought to make clear that men and women have distinct understandings of morality which influence the way in which they respond to ethics and behaving ethically.

### Issues in technology that the Ethics of Care would say much about

The ethics of care have a lot to say about in many different issues in computer technology. 

1.	Software and Users 
	Many computer technology companies, especially social network platforms do not preserve and protect the rights and information of the users. According to the ethics of care, this information should be held responsible by the software companies and realize the vulnerability of the users. Users should be treated with care and respect and therefore companies should follow through with their responsibilities and actively prevent users’ information to be stolen.

2.	User Experience
	The user experience that is provided to different users must be speculated and paid special attention to. It has been an issue that many female users have reported their gender identity were being insulted in their experience interacting with certain software, or information provided by users. These software companies are accountable for their messages and should respect different genders, races, and disabilities. Many companies have refined their actions, such as providing emojis of different gender and races, designing their interface catering to users with color vision deficiencies.

3.	In the Workplace
	At workspaces, especially in computer technology working environment, there is a gender imbalance between male and female engineers and often times female engineers are being disrespected. The ethics of care emphasizes protecting the interests and rights of all genders and races and employers should address such issues and provide female engineers with equal opportunities and respect. Administrators of different workspaces should also acknowledge details of minority workers and providing them with a good working environment and the care they needed.

## Ethics of Care and IEEE Code of Conduct

When comparing the IEEE code of ethics with the ethical framework laid out by Ethics of Care, one can observe that the IEEE does partly focus on the relationship of professionals to the public and to fellow colleagues. This notion of relationship to others is something on which Ethics of Care places great emphasis. This similarity can especially be seen in points one and eight of the IEEE code of ethics, which concern the general welfare of the public and the treatment of other persons, respectively. Likewise, points nine and ten stress the importance of proper and professional behavior in relation to the public and colleagues. 


On the other hand, there does indeed exist certain differences between the two, mainly in the overall goal of the respective schools of thought. In the IEEE code of ethics, a distinctly professional diction is used, and one can see this focus in lines such as “to maintain and improve our technical competence and to undertake technological tasks”. In addition to this, IEEE outlines broad guidelines for proper behavior in the technical field, as well as how to deal with emerging technologies. Ethics of Care, however, is far more concerned with personal relationships, rather than providing a guideline to ethical behavior in a professional sense. On this note, a major difference between the IEEE code of ethics and Ethics of Care lies in the fact the IEEE provided a very general framework in its code, while Ethics of Care emphasizes a much narrower scope, attempting to focus on the very important aspect of human interaction.


The most notable missing part from the IEEE code of ethics with regards to incorporating the Ethics of Care is a sense of care and benevolence between professionals in the technical field and clients, or those who are recipients of the goods, services, etc. This sense of a caring relationship between people can certainly also be applied between peers in the field. If the IEEE code of ethics were to add a few points to guide the nature of ethical relationships within the field, then it would undoubtedly be more in line with the Ethics of Care.

## Ethics of Care and ACM Code of Conduct

The ACM code of ethics is almost entirely geared towards applying ethics towards a variety of professions, such as providing guidelines for those in a higher up occupation so as to not abuse their power against their employees. An ethicist following the ethics of care would be in opposition to the pure purpose of this code of ethics, primarily due to the fact that it is still encouraging for those in power to view their employees as subordinates and simply do not abuse them, while an ethicist of care would argue that employees should be seen as equals and that the primary focus should be building a relationship with them. Hence, this is a key difference between the two systems. Another difference is the fact that the ACM code of ethics emphasizes that the “central concerns” of computing work are “the public good” and “high quality”, while ethics of care based system would argue that relationships between both customer and company as well as inter-employee relations should be the key focus. However, both of these ethical guidelines do have similarities, particularly in the fact that the ACM still does stress that professionals still need to care for their employees and treat them with respect. Also, the ACM states that all its professionals should” Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization or group”, which in turn also encourages for people to build relationships inside of their own organization to hopefully improve the quality of the group. The ACM code of ethics, though, still could learn from the ideologies of Ethics of Care, maybe by adding a few more points stressing the fact that both professional and friendly relationships between professionals should be encouraged as it helps people to grow and have a more enjoyable life.

## Ethics of Care and ICCP Code of Conduct

There are a number of notable similarities between Ethics of Care and the ICCP Code of Ethics. As Ethics of Care stresses the importance of relationships, one could look to the ICCP’s Code of Ethics’ Code of Conduct section. Specifically, the subsections on Integrity (2.5), Accountability (2.7), and Protection of Privacy (2.8) all particularly align with some principles of Ethics of Care. Integrity in a hypothetical relationship of ICCP members works both ways -- employers should not take advantage of their employees, and employees should be upfront with their employers. Accountability requires competence and responsibility, both integral in Ethics of Care. Last, for Protection of Privacy, the trust of both parties is essential for relationships, so there is quite a bit of overlap between the code and Care Ethics. 


Despite the many similarities, there are differences between the Ethics of Care framework and the ICCP Code of Ethics. For example, there are large parts of the ICCP’s Code of Ethics concerning how a member may lose their status, which seems to directly conflict with the fundamentals of Care Ethics (by limiting relationships). Additionally, a lot of the guidelines seem to exist as reminders of professional and societal obligations. In fact, the word “obligation” appears 3 times in the first 4 sentences of the ICCP Code of Ethics. Ethics of Care, on the other hand, stress the difference between obligation and responsibility, claiming that obligations are limited to socially constructed roles while responsibilities aren’t. 


This difference between words could actually be expanded to address how the ICCP Code of Ethics could improve by taking from Care Ethics. Where Ethics of Care is about the personal, the ICCP Code of Ethics is about the professional. If the ICCP were to expand their Code to include more on the interpersonal connections in the work environment, they could address this missing area.
