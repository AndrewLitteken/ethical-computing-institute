## “Caring requires paying attention, seeing, listening, responding with respect. Its logic is contextual, psychological. Care is a relational ethic, grounded in a premise of interdependence. But it is not selfless.”
### ― Carol Gilligan, *Joining the Resistance*

## H-1B Visas

One of the biggest arguments of the H-1B visa system is that it allows workers from other countries to work in the United States for American companies. According to the USCIS H-1B general requirements, these foreign employees must be highly skilled workers who have a Bachelor's degree or equivalent education or training. This essentially means that the program allows for high-skilled workers to come into the US and fill roles that are highly in demand, essentially combatting local talent shortages especially in the tech industry that is booming.  While under the H-1B visa the worker can apply for permanent residency in the US, which creates a path for foreign nationals to become US citizens if they so wish.  Another argument in favor of the H-1B visa system is that these holders typically become small business owners and job creators, who drive innovation and help build the US economy. Finally, the last arguments for the H-1B visa system is that it allows companies to hire workers with a wider range of upbringings, experiences, and perspectives essentially creating diversity in their company.  

The biggest argument against the H-1B visa is that these workers are getting taken advantage of by the companies that hire them. IEEE-USA points out in the article titled “Commentary: The H-1B Visa Problem as IEEE-USA Sees It” that  Smartorg pays software engineers on H-1B visas in Menlo Park only $80,000 annually, which is a ridiculously low salary for the San Jose region, compared to Facebook's $138,294. As a consequence, companies can hire the same level of talent for a cheaper rate, which some argue takes jobs away from American Workers. People see the H-1B as a tool used by companies to avoid hiring American workers and avoid paying American wages. In addition to this, employees cannot obtain an H-1B visa unless they are sponsored by an employer. The employer must typically cover any legal fees required to process their sponsorship if they even acquire an H-1B visa as there is a limited number of them available. In addition to this, in the article, “Engineers Are Leaving Trump’s America for the Canadian Dream” having a H-1B visa comes with a lot of uncertainty as an employer can fire their employee and take away their right to be in the country, creating significant stress. As a result, many of these workers apply for green cards, but as the article states, many have been waiting “a decade or more for their green cards and still don't have them”.

Applying Care Ethics to the H-1B visas situation is somewhat complicated. On one hand, the emphasis on relationships could lead one to believe that this ethical framework would employ a “more is better” policy, and simply take as many visas as citizens of other countries require. Despite being unfeasible from a logistics standpoint, followers of Care Ethics would be hesitant to take visas due to the several aforementioned current flaws with the system; a valid question being “Is it really better to take in everyone if they might be exploited, treated unfairly, and generally not cared for as well as US citizens?”. Ultimately, our ethical of framework would have a lot to change on both sides -- that is, how many H-1B visas are allowed and the employer-employee dynamic with visa workers -- of the controversy as it is currently.

First, Ethics of Care would suggest that visas should be easier to obtain. This way, those looking to come to the United States could fulfill their dream, jobs would get filled within companies, but, most importantly, relationships could flourish and continue to give people new perspectives into the lives of others around the world. This way, when both the people receiving visas and their employers/coworkers move forward in life, they can take their new, more worldly points of view into future relationships and actions. In order for both parties to benefit, both sides of process must change. This means it should be quicker for a person to receive a green card, or they should be provided more benefits during their visa duration. Additionally, employers should get an easier time trying to bring on/sponsor a citizen of another country. 

Second, Care Ethics would not tolerate the current exploitation of visa workers. Companies getting employees with visas can be good, but getting those employees just to avoid paying a standard industry wage is not okay. Furthermore, workers with visas need to receive more benefits, rights, and/or guarantees concerning their status as employees in the US. If a company has all the power over their visa worker(s), it can take advantage and abuse in its relationships. Ethics of Care would suggest that all employees do the same work be paid the same, since that seems like the most practical and fair way to maintain and grow relationships.

With these fundamental changes to the state of visas in the US, followers of Ethics of Care would be big proponents of the H-1B visa system. 

## Google Internal Memeo

The internal Google memo that was circulating inside the company in 2017 received much backlash both from inside the company and out. The employee who wrote it was eventually fired and his ideas dismissed. The memo actually addressed several different issues that the author wanted to bring up. The author discussed the idea that left and   ideals have a difference of opinion on when it comes to disparities like a gender gap. The author says that left ideals hold that gaps like this are because of injustices while right ideals would say that these gaps are natural. The author goes on to say that instead of bias against women in tech, their biology simply makes working in tech not an appealing place for women. Finally, the author lists some things Google might do in order to close the gender gap that are not, in the author’s opinion, discriminatory as some of their other initiatives are such as classes only for a certain race/gender. The author makes his viewpoint very clear by constantly referring to many of the diversity and inclusion practices that Google employes as discriminatory. As to who is being discriminated by these practices the authors never explicitly states but it can be implied that it is white men.

In terms of the ethics of care, most of the arguments presented by the author would absolutely be morally bad, there are a few points in the memo through that the ethics of care might agree with. The first of these points is the idea that is presented in the memo that in order to close the gender gap we could institute programs such that make tech industries more appealing to women. The Ethics of Care came about trying to come up with a system of ethics that appeals more to women, by instituting programs that both are good for the business but also help women relate to the company by being more compassionate, more people oriented, and more focused on how women work and what a woman wants out of a job. Going off of this the Ethics of Care might also acknowledge that men and women do indeed have some difference in traits as a whole and when trying to close the gender gap these traits should be taken into account. 

In contrast, the Ethics of Care would have a lot of issues with many of the the viewpoints put forward in the memo. One of the main issues the Ethics of Care would have is that the author says in order to make unbiased decisions one should leave feelings out of the decision. The Ethics of Care would consider this to be terrible as caring for others is a central part of the Ethical System.  In order for one to evaluate how ethical something is one must consider how one is caring for others and caring for oneself. In this same line of thinking, the author saying that programs that help traditionally underrepresented people are discriminatory would not be in line with the Ethics of care as they are not caring about those underrepresented people and this line of thought doesn’t take into account why these programs exist. A person following the Ethics of Care would see that these programs are needed because for some reason or another these people are underrepresented and need care. Finally one of the final points that the Author raises that the Ethics of Care would take issue with is the idea that gender issues should be demoralized, gender issues deal with people and relationships so by definition the Ethics of Care would say that gender issues absolutely fall under morality and should be thought of as such.  In closing the Google Memo is clearly a very polarizing topic and it helps to examine it in the ways that we have here to fully understand its context and its goals. 

## Analysis of Gender Bias in Tech

There are several issues concerning gender affecting the technology industry today. First, as it stands, the male to female ratio in technology jobs, which some studies say is 80/20, does not reflect the population ratio, which is roughly 50/50. This is a very complex issue and there are a few ideas as to why it exists. The leading theory is that, from a young age, across a population, boys and girls are implicitly pushed towards certain career paths. Generations and generations of gender roles have created these perceptions. Seeing mostly men in technological roles creates a perception that tech. jobs are more suited for men than women. Others take the point of view that, due to evolution, men are physically more suited for jobs in technology than women and that is why this gender gap exists. This is the nature versus nurture debate. A few years ago, an internal Google memo supporting this viewpoint challenged diversity and minority programs at technology companies and created a lot of controversy throughout the technology industry. 

Another Gender issue is sexual harassment. In a recent article, CNN outlined the stories of several women who have been harassed in the tech industry. In some instances, Venture Capitalists and investors used their positions of power to sexually harass female entrepreneurs. Because they had the power to withdraw funding from the entrepreneur's company, they were able to get away with extremely inappropriate behavior. This is a result of both the major gender gap in the industry and extreme amounts of money creating major power imbalances.

To respond to the first issue about the gender gap, the Ethics of Care framework would support the theory that it is due to historical gender roles. Feminist Ethics and the Ethics of Care were created in response to the perceived gender bias in traditional ethical frameworks. Furthermore, Ethics of Care would call on women in technology roles to develop relationships with young girls and women and help show them that they are able to be successful in the field if they want to. This does not necessarily just need to be between an adult and a child. For instance, an executive helping a recent graduate would be important as well. These relationships are what the Ethics of Care is based on. Eventually, these relationships would bring more women into technology, reducing the common perception that tech. jobs are more suited for men and close the gender gap.

In response to the problem with sexual misconduct, Ethics of Care would suggest that it is the responsibility of everyone in the environment to actively and vocally not tolerate that type of behavior. In order to preserve relationships with female coworkers and all other females, people would need to stand up for them or else damage their relationships. Tolerating sexual assault in a single instance contributes to a culture of tolerance, which will impact all the females around someone. Lastly, it is important to note that these issues will not be solved overnight. Changing a culture takes a lot of time and will require patience and persistence. However, forming strong relationships and taking on these issues as a group will help strengthen these traits and push progress forward.

## Analysis of Race and Ethnicity Issues in Tech

In the technology field, particularly in the scope of computer science, there without a doubt exists a bias towards race and ethnicity. In terms of race and ethnicity, majorly underrepresented groups, both on the academic level and in the professional field, include people of African, Hispanic, or Native American heritage, as well as international people. Among other issues, people who identify with these ethnicities and backgrounds have been reported to feel isolated or unrepresented in the technology field as a whole, which in turn has created a severe lack a diversity and variance of perspectives.
 
One of the biggest areas where this problem persists is in education. According to research studies, black students are less likely to have the opportunity to take computer science classes in school, and furthermore, black and Hispanic students are less likely than white students to have access to computers at home. These small examples, combined with a plethora of related research one can find online, point to a culture in which students of certain races and ethnicities have not received the opportunities that would help to inspire future computer science studies. This issue is only exacerbated when looking at the diversity of computer science majors, where the groups discussed here only make up a fraction of students pursuing a computer science degree at the university level.
 
A related issue that highlights a lack of ethnic diversity in the tech field can be observed from the professional field, in which minorities are likewise underrepresented. While this can be seen as the result of the issues existing in the education process, as discussed above, these deficiencies are nevertheless prominent. The way in which tech companies recruit students is something that has seriously affected the makeup of the workforce in the tech industry.  Similarly, the dominance of people who identify as white, including in the workforce but especially in upper-level management, has certainly also contributed to the problem.
 
Although the Ethics of Care framework does not have a clear-cut solution to lessening and ultimately eliminating biases towards race and ethnicity in the tech field, one can nevertheless apply its principles to this complex issue. In terms of education, when one considers a loving and caring relationship, it is beyond doubt that the parties involved in this relationship both would wish the best for each other. As a result, Ethics of Care would promote the encouragement of pursuing whatever interests best suit and benefit a given person. If someone truly cares for another, then this person would help a fellow friend achieve the highest success possible, regardless of race or ethnicity. If someone we care about expresses an affinity for the tech field, we must foster this passion, so as to strengthen our caring relationship with this person.
 
Similarly, the professional field can be strengthened by an uptake in ethnic diversity, which would certainly promote unique and diverse relationships. Part of caring for others entails including all people, and in terms of the professional field, this would manifest itself in the recruitment of all people, with the goal of creating a workforce comprising of diverse-minded, intelligent, and hard-working people. Ultimately, the inclusion of all people is tantamount to caring for others, so Ethics of Care is undoubtedly pertinent to the issues regarding race and ethnicity in today’s tech world.

## Statement Of Purpose

### What Makes An Action Ethical According to the Ethics of Care?

To evaluate actions with the Ethics of Care framework, one must look at how the action affects the person performing the action and the people that are being cared for by that person. If an action ignores the well-being of either of those two parties, it is unethical. However, if both parties’ interests are met, the action is ethical. Furthermore, the relationships that are impacted by the action should be evaluated. In the framework, relationships are between unequal parties. For example, a parent and a child. Because one’s moral development is defined by the relationships that they are involved in, actions that sever relationships are unethical and actions that strengthen relationships are ethical. In summation, the Ethics of Care framework emphasizes maintaining and strengthening connections to others, as well as protecting the interests of those involved, as a collective unit.

### What triggers the need to evaluate how ethical an action is?

With the framework of Care Ethics in mind, actions must be evaluated for how ethical they are when these actions impact those we care about or are connected to. The Ethics of Care emphasizes the connections to others and maintaining those connections, as well as protecting the interests of those involved, as a collective unit. When making decisions that affect others, we must be mindful of how ethical our decision will be. In this way when some action impacts a relationship between any two parties the ethics of care would ask one to step in and evalute how ethical the action is. This can be many different kinds of relationships including by not limited to: company and customer, employer and developer, and developer and customer.  


### What predisposition do people have to act ethically according to the Ethics of Care?

According to the ethics of care, the predisposition people have to act ethically is influenced by gender. Men are predisposed to act in an ethical manner according to abstract ideas of justice and duty, whereas women act ethically according to ideas of empathy and compassion. Because ethics and what one deems to be ethical is rooted in a moral system, men and women are predisposed to acting ethically with regard to their respective moral systems.  This idea is essential to the ethics of care as its founder, Carol Gilligan, sought to make clear that men and women have distinct understandings of morality which influence the way in which they respond to ethics and behaving ethically.

### Issues in technology that the Ethics of Care would say much about

The ethics of care have a lot to say about in many different issues in computer technology. 

1.	Software and Users 
	Many computer technology companies, especially social network platforms do not preserve and protect the rights and information of the users. According to the ethics of care, this information should be held responsible by the software companies and realize the vulnerability of the users. Users should be treated with care and respect and therefore companies should follow through with their responsibilities and actively prevent users’ information to be stolen.

2.	User Experience
	The user experience that is provided to different users must be speculated and paid special attention to. It has been an issue that many female users have reported their gender identity were being insulted in their experience interacting with certain software, or information provided by users. These software companies are accountable for their messages and should respect different genders, races, and disabilities. Many companies have refined their actions, such as providing emojis of different gender and races, designing their interface catering to users with color vision deficiencies.

3.	In the Workplace
	At workspaces, especially in computer technology working environment, there is a gender imbalance between male and female engineers and often times female engineers are being disrespected. The ethics of care emphasizes protecting the interests and rights of all genders and races and employers should address such issues and provide female engineers with equal opportunities and respect. Administrators of different workspaces should also acknowledge details of minority workers and providing them with a good working environment and the care they needed.

## Ethics of Care and IEEE Code of Conduct

When comparing the IEEE code of ethics with the ethical framework laid out by Ethics of Care, one can observe that the IEEE does partly focus on the relationship of professionals to the public and to fellow colleagues. This notion of relationship to others is something on which Ethics of Care places great emphasis. This similarity can especially be seen in points one and eight of the IEEE code of ethics, which concern the general welfare of the public and the treatment of other persons, respectively. Likewise, points nine and ten stress the importance of proper and professional behavior in relation to the public and colleagues. 


On the other hand, there does indeed exist certain differences between the two, mainly in the overall goal of the respective schools of thought. In the IEEE code of ethics, a distinctly professional diction is used, and one can see this focus in lines such as “to maintain and improve our technical competence and to undertake technological tasks”. In addition to this, IEEE outlines broad guidelines for proper behavior in the technical field, as well as how to deal with emerging technologies. Ethics of Care, however, is far more concerned with personal relationships, rather than providing a guideline to ethical behavior in a professional sense. On this note, a major difference between the IEEE code of ethics and Ethics of Care lies in the fact the IEEE provided a very general framework in its code, while Ethics of Care emphasizes a much narrower scope, attempting to focus on the very important aspect of human interaction.


The most notable missing part from the IEEE code of ethics with regards to incorporating the Ethics of Care is a sense of care and benevolence between professionals in the technical field and clients, or those who are recipients of the goods, services, etc. This sense of a caring relationship between people can certainly also be applied between peers in the field. If the IEEE code of ethics were to add a few points to guide the nature of ethical relationships within the field, then it would undoubtedly be more in line with the Ethics of Care.

## Ethics of Care and ACM Code of Conduct

The ACM code of ethics is almost entirely geared towards applying ethics towards a variety of professions, such as providing guidelines for those in a higher up occupation so as to not abuse their power against their employees. An ethicist following the ethics of care would be in opposition to the pure purpose of this code of ethics, primarily due to the fact that it is still encouraging for those in power to view their employees as subordinates and simply do not abuse them, while an ethicist of care would argue that employees should be seen as equals and that the primary focus should be building a relationship with them. Hence, this is a key difference between the two systems. Another difference is the fact that the ACM code of ethics emphasizes that the “central concerns” of computing work are “the public good” and “high quality”, while ethics of care based system would argue that relationships between both customer and company as well as inter-employee relations should be the key focus. However, both of these ethical guidelines do have similarities, particularly in the fact that the ACM still does stress that professionals still need to care for their employees and treat them with respect. Also, the ACM states that all its professionals should” Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization or group”, which in turn also encourages for people to build relationships inside of their own organization to hopefully improve the quality of the group. The ACM code of ethics, though, still could learn from the ideologies of Ethics of Care, maybe by adding a few more points stressing the fact that both professional and friendly relationships between professionals should be encouraged as it helps people to grow and have a more enjoyable life.

## Ethics of Care and ICCP Code of Conduct

There are a number of notable similarities between Ethics of Care and the ICCP Code of Ethics. As Ethics of Care stresses the importance of relationships, one could look to the ICCP’s Code of Ethics’ Code of Conduct section. Specifically, the subsections on Integrity (2.5), Accountability (2.7), and Protection of Privacy (2.8) all particularly align with some principles of Ethics of Care. Integrity in a hypothetical relationship of ICCP members works both ways -- employers should not take advantage of their employees, and employees should be upfront with their employers. Accountability requires competence and responsibility, both integral in Ethics of Care. Last, for Protection of Privacy, the trust of both parties is essential for relationships, so there is quite a bit of overlap between the code and Care Ethics. 


Despite the many similarities, there are differences between the Ethics of Care framework and the ICCP Code of Ethics. For example, there are large parts of the ICCP’s Code of Ethics concerning how a member may lose their status, which seems to directly conflict with the fundamentals of Care Ethics (by limiting relationships). Additionally, a lot of the guidelines seem to exist as reminders of professional and societal obligations. In fact, the word “obligation” appears 3 times in the first 4 sentences of the ICCP Code of Ethics. Ethics of Care, on the other hand, stress the difference between obligation and responsibility, claiming that obligations are limited to socially constructed roles while responsibilities aren’t. 


This difference between words could actually be expanded to address how the ICCP Code of Ethics could improve by taking from Care Ethics. Where Ethics of Care is about the personal, the ICCP Code of Ethics is about the professional. If the ICCP were to expand their Code to include more on the interpersonal connections in the work environment, they could address this missing area.
