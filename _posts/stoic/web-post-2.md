### Analysis of Gender Bias in Tech:
___

When it comes to gender issues in tech, stoicism is certainly having a moment. Many people are turning to this ethical framework to address key problems, specifically the belief that there are innate gender differences that account for different levels of ability, interests, preferences, or intelligence between men and women. To expand on this discrimination, a quote in Liza Mundy’s article for the Atlantic reads, “Women not only are hired in lower numbers than men are; they also leave tech at more than twice the rate men do… studies show that women who work in tech are interrupted in meetings more often than men. They are evaluated on their personality in a way that men are not. They are less likely to get funding from venture capitalists…And in a particularly cruel irony, women’s contributions to open-source software are accepted more often than men’s are, but only if their gender is unknown.” As if blatant bias and misrepresentation wasn’t enough, women are consistently judged, even by themselves, as lacking the “genius” trait that define the stereotypical male tech guru, and by consequence don’t consider a role in the industry or aren’t considered by others for more technical roles.

However, research on gender differences is often interpreted incorrectly. In many cases, the societal shaping, pressures, environment and unconscious bias is not incorporated into explaining studies. One thing research does conclude is that there is no hardwired difference between men and women. Instead, these differences arise from the societal boundaries that have historically defined gender. So far, the industry’s answer to gender issues has been understanding and identifying bias.

Unconscious-bias training is based on the idea that everyone holds natural biases. The key is to be aware of the bias and actively fight against it. Experts are also recommending changing the structure of a company or system. By implementing a set of requirements and procedures that change the way historically biased operations are carried out, like hiring, promoting, and idea generating, companies can prevent people from acting on their bias in the first place. 

Stoicism would offer a different solution, one that would require society to change its behavior and perception of women in tech. Stoicism emphasizes that all people have the same capacity for virtue and the same ability to achieve virtue, regardless of their circumstances. For the Stoics, recognizing equality as humans is a necessity to live virtuously and attain the ultimate goal of happiness.  A major component of virtue is serving other human beings and recognizing people’s common humanity. It was the Stoics who encouraged people to not define themselves or others by location, class, gender, or religion. The only true way to live in agreement with nature is to focus on what makes people similar and form a world community that goes beyond local differences.

Stoicism focuses on what one can control, so focusing on actions rather on the outcome is necessary. With this comes the idea that Stoics are ultimately responsible for what they do—they focus on deliberate and rational actions. By not acting or failing to change a system or environment that is oppressive to others, people cannot attain the ultimate goal—so gender bias has no place in this ethical framework.


### Response to Internal Google Memo:
___

In August 2017, Gizmodo.com reported on a 10-page memo written by a nameless male Google employee that was spreading amongst company employees. The employee was expressing his disagreements with initiatives within Google and beyond to ensure equal representation between female and male workers in tech, an industry long dominated by men. Such initiatives include the prioritization of diversity during the hiring process and the birth of several company programs that are open exclusively to women. The employee believes these initiatives exist due to an incorrect sentiment within society that women and men should equally represented in all fields of work. 

He believes that there are inherent, physiological differences between men and women that make certain genders more apt for certain careers. He then presents several differences that might explain why there is (and, therefore, naturally should be) a gender gap in tech, expanding on each point in depth. Additionally, the memo’s author disagrees with Google’s diversity initiative as he believes it is founded on false political biases to create equality in all representation. He strongly believes that acknowledgement of inherent differences between men and women is not sexist, and is, in fact, necessary to effectively address the social well-being of those in the workplace.

To a Stoic, some elements of the memo’s argument are quite respectable. The author founds his argument on the belief that gender-equality initiatives are the result of incorrect biases and beliefs. While making specific suggestions to improve gender relations in the industry, he states, “Relying on affective empathy—feeling another’s pain—causes us to focus on anecdotes, favor individuals similar to us, and harbor other irrational and dangerous biases. Being emotionally unengaged helps us better reason about the facts.” Stoics champion the absence of biases and passion during decision-making, making this aspect of his argument very appealing. The author seems to respect the intentions of the initiatives he criticizes – he just wants to limit discussion to established facts and not personal anecdotes. 

There is another aspect of his argument that Stoics like. He takes issue with the culture of “shaming” directed towards those with right-wing beliefs. He states, “Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence.” Stoics certainly disagree with a culture of shaming – it is often an oppressive action based on intense emotion. Differing beliefs are inevitable, and it is important for individuals within a company to be comfortable communicating with each other.

Stoics, however, will be hard-pressed to ignore certain flaws with the memo. Most glaringly, the memo presents many alleged facts regarding physiological differences between men and women – without supplying sources for such information. As the majority of his argument is dependent on these claims being true, it is crucial that he supply citation – yet he does not. There is no reason for a Stoic to believe his claims over the beliefs of those he derides. Additionally, he presents certain “alleged” physiological differences, yet only uses them to show why a woman less likely to be a good fit for a tech role. Despite acknowledging that many inherent differences exist, though, he does not acknowledge the possibility that some differences may give an average female a unique value not possessed by the average male. This shows a possible bias on the part of the author to cherrypick only the facts that support his views. He tries to avoid allegations of bias by claiming himself as “a classical liberal” who “strongly values individualism and reason,” but this does not make him impervious to allegations of bias.

Overall, Stoics appreciate his call for a discussion on gender issues void of all emotional engagement and bias, but have trouble overlooking the lack of sources for many of his foundational claims, as well as his alarming tendency to only acknowledge woman’s inherent differences as flaws in the tech industry. With proper source documentation and consideration (as well as rebuttals) of more arguments that run counter to his beliefs, this Google memo would fare significantly better in winning over those of a Stoic mindset.
