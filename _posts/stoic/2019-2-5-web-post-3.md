### Issues in Corporate Ethical Responsibility in Tech

Corporate ethical and social responsibility in technology has become a frontrunning issue in American society as technology companies have ballooned in size and reach.  Issues in marketing and advertising, social spheres in society, and corporate size and power have all become hot-button topics today.

Marketing, and more specifically advertising by and on social media platforms, has become a target of much outrage in America today.  Increasingly, companies are stepping out in their own advertisements to highlight and consider the issues plaguing American society.  One such example is recent advertising by Twitter addressing gender equality that featured prominent female figures.  However, despite the advertisement in support of a major topic in American society today, Twitter still suffered from mounting criticism of its handling of gender equality in its own labor practices and its practices with gender equality and harassment on its platform.  The public today increasingly supports corporate social responsibility, but in genuine, impactful ways - not simply making an advertisement and not following through.  Companies need to live up to the standards of the public and the standards that they themselves self-impose, and anything short of those goals will seriously impact public opinion and support (both socially and financially) in most likely a negative way. 

Major classical “social” issues also permeate corporate ethical responsibility today.  One such example is the environmental impact of technology companies.  Emissions, energy production and use, and product makeup are all major factors that major technology companies receive low marks in.  Companies like Amazon, with its ubiquitous two-day for its members, greatly contributes to Amazon’s greenhouse gas impact. Similarly, technology companies need increasingly large amounts of power to feed their growing collection of devices and data centers.  Switching from fossil fuels to more environmentally friendly sources would help drive American energy use to new heights in the 21st century. Another such social issue in technology today is the power of data in politics.  Most prominently, Facebook has been accused of allowing the spread of deliberately false or misleading information on its platform which has been indicated in many of the recent elections and votes in America and abroad.  This begs the question: what role do major corporations have in the political sphere, and does the “corporate personhood” upload for the political realm?  Technology companies are increasingly having to answer to the public and government about its role current and where these companies’ power should be in the future.

Arguably the largest corporate social responsibility issue concerning technology companies today is the issue of their size.  The five largest companies by market capitalization in the world are major technology companies.  This fact has raised eyebrows and caused many to eye these companies’ shortcoming and the possibility for antitrust actions.  This size issue has also raised specific issues in technology today, especially for these corporate giants.  As more companies look to gather big data on their consumers, more and more people are keeping watch.  We see this issue with Facebook, as stated before on their political implications.  According to testimony from Facebook and others, Facebook collected and sold data on its customers to data companies which was then used in elections.  Similarly, major companies like Google and Microsoft have had issues with information flow to their customers.  Both companies have been accused of promoting their own products and services on their platforms over competitors - a serious violation of anti-competition laws.  Finally, other major technology companies like Comcast and Amazon have been under scrutiny for their supposed consumer access practices.  With the fate of net neutrality still up in the air, companies like Comcast stand to gain from unregulated internet access, allowing Comcast to throttle or wholly block competitors from customers who use Comcast’s services.  Similarly, Amazon has been known to undercut and eventually buy out competitors on its online marketplace using Amazon branded practices, which could severely limit consumer access to a variety of products at a variety of price points.


### A Stoic Critique of Google's Project Maven

Google has been contracted (expiring in 2019) to work with the Department of Defense in the development of AI technology for military usage. This project is known as 'Project Maven'. The AI tech is specifically meant to speed up the process of analyzing video images. This of course has been speculated to be used in more accurate drone strikes. Thousands of Google's employees signed a letter urging the CEO to not renew its contract with the Department of Defense, as they do not want to be involved in making technology for use in war. Many employees resigned as well. Due to the severe backlash, Google will not be renewing the contract after it expires in 2019. Some senior executives in the company stated that the contract was not worth much and Google was simply providing open-source code for the Pentagon. However, recovered emails indicate that the executives viewed this contract as a stepping stone to even more military and intelligence contracts, opening up a whole new market of business. Google was not simply providing open-source code, but developing machine learning algorithms, aiming to create AI technology that would be able to surveil entire cities. The executives were well aware that the contract would be controversial in the public eye when initially inking the deal. It appears that executives were also dishonest with employees, telling them that it was a $9 million project. This is false as it is estimated that it was at least a $15 million project. Google worked closely with the Pentagon, setting milestones. They even made the terms in the contract that the Pentagon wouldn't publicly list Google as a partner.

Stoics believe that the goal is a world of happiness, willed by the gods. The only way to achieve this is by everyone making virtuous decisions at every opportunity. Virtue is the only thing that triggers happiness. Virtuous decisions are based in reason, rationality, and are free of passion. In addition, Stoics believe humans are motivated by their self love of their rationality, not just their physical bodies. This ties in to causing happiness through virtue for other members of the human race. Through a Stoic's eyes, Google committed multiple actions with vice, not virtue.

By choosing to help develop AI technology for the Pentagon that would be used in drone strikes, Google is fully contributing to war. It is certainly not a virtuous action, as drone strikes are designed to kill people, much of the time they kill innocent people. A Stoic would not find it reasonable for a public company like Google to be involved in war in anyway. There are many employees and stockholders who would indirectly or directly be involved, despite only the executives deciding to go into the military market. Also, it is clear that Google's executives withheld information from employees and the public for the sake of more profit. They stated that the project was smaller than it really was, trying to minimize employees' fears. The executives also lied about the role Google played in development. They claimed that the deal was of little value and simply provided the Department of Defense with open-source code, when in reality they were directly developing algorithms for AI technology. They discussed goals and milestones with the Pentagon, including the vision of being able to surveil cities. They spoke excitedly in emails about future endeavors in the military and intelligence space, seeing this contract as the first of many. All of these actions indicate the opposite of the executives' attempt to imply Google did very little to assist the Department of Defense's AI technology.

There are two main despicable actions by Google in the eyes of a Stoic. Directly contributing to war and harm to others by making technology that will be used to harm others and blatantly being dishonest to its own employees and the public. War and doing harm to others is a vice as it solely causes unhappiness. It is not reasonable to cause pain to fellow humans, as causing happiness to each other is truly virtuous. Humans are bonded together by our self-love of rationality, so from a Stoic's perspective, there should be no reason to participate in war. A Stoic believes in making decisions free of passion, so that includes not being affected by any patriotic emotions. In addition, it is a vice to rob another human of the truth. Since this is a scenario where money was the main motivation, it was not reasonable for the Google executives to be dishonest. As stated early, a Stoic would point out that as humans, we are required to act with virtue at all times, which includes treating other humans in a respectful way.

A Stoic knows it is not rational to lament over past mistakes, as that would bring in unnecessary emotion. The ethical way to resolve this is to not renew the contract with the Department of Defense, to not cause further harm, as they have already done. A Stoic would commend Google for making the ethical decision over making more money in the future. Ethically, Google should have never inked the contract with the Department of Defense in the first place, if it was to create war technology. Even with the contract, Google should have been completely transparent in their dealings with the Pentagon for the sake of its employees and the public. Instead, Google piled onto their unethical decision  by continuing to lie about their exact role. To put it simply, Google needs to make every decision with virtue, not profit to be aligned with the Stoic ethical framework. There are surely times where these two mindsets end up with the same ultimate decision. Also, there are many decisions that Google makes that are indifferents, causing no happiness or unhappiness. However, in this case, it is very clear that Google committed vices as their actions only caused unhappiness. It also sparks another debate in exactly how closely should companies follow this framework. I think a Stoic would reason that Google should still focus on profits, but only virtuous or indifferent decisions.
