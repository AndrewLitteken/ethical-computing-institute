### Summary of Key Issies and Stakeholders in Job Automation
	After reading the articles, there are a few key groups that stand out who will be impacted by the global trend of job automation. McDonalds is a key stakeholder in the issue of job automation. McDonalds strove (and really still strives) to completely rationalize all elements of their production line. They want to find the single most efficient method for completing each task. The effects of this are actually slightly irrational, which is a side effect of over-rationalized systems. Workers who are trained to do only one task burn out. From a business standpoint, workers with low skill sets ae easily trained and easily replaceable, however employees have very little skills to offer to the job market. Another outcome of this system is that consumers start to do the tasks that workers traditionally did, like bussing tables and retrieving food, which decreases labor demands, but also decreases customer experience. 
	Additionally, the Apple and Samsung supplier Foxconn replaced 60,000 factory workers with robots. The effects of this job automation were that many of the manufacturing tasks associated with the company’s operations are now completed by robots, and by consequence the workers who previously held those positions lost their jobs. The company claims that the employees who held these repetitive-task positions benefited from the takeover—they reportedly trained their employees and enabled them to focus on higher value elements in the manufacturing process like research and development, and process and quality control, which are jobs that require more skilled labor.
	A less obvious group that is directly affected by job automation is the government. Not only would the decline in labor force literally upturn the tax and income distribution policy’s in America, but the American people would also expect more services and benefits to be provided to them by the government that had previously been provided to them via their jobs. There are also a number of societal and cultural changes that would need to be addressed that will arise from the transformation of country founded on hard work into a much idler society.
	From a stoic’s point of view, the engineers involved in designing job automation systems that replace human workers would not be held ethically responsible for the job loss that resulted. A stoic might argue that as long as the engineer had pure and good intentions, acted rationally throughout the process and was striving toward bettering themselves and the world around them, they acted rightly. On that note, a worker who lost their job to an automated system would personally be ethically responsible for pursuing a more valued and virtuous skill, while the company who replaced their job in the first place would be responsible for helping to train and reposition that employee. The future of job automation can be understood by this process through the eyes of the Stoics. That is to say, automation should not be avoided or stopped for the sake of job security, but a consequence of this trend will be the demand for a broader personal responsibly that will require action from all parties that are affected.
