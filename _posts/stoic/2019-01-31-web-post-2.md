### Discussion of the H-1B Visa System

Proponents of the H-1B visa systems argue that it encourages the migration of skilled laborers to the US by providing additional inlets to the country as long as they secure work in desired fields, and it is true that in the modern quota-based immigration system, the H-1B and H-1B2 are essentially opening up additional slots for workers with merits that are currently considered “special.” It is also true that the H1-B visa requires sponsorship from an employer, which can give employers some choice in the workforce coming in to America and guarantee work to skilled laborers before their visas are issued. Because re-applications are allowed and don’t fall within the 85,000 visa cap, the H-1B can be continuously renewed as an option for continued living in the United States. In a more abstract sense, it ensures that skilled workers with degrees from outside the country to share ideas from abroad and increase the diversity of thought in American business.

Opponents of the H-1B allege that it is unfair to workers and other countries can make the US look bad by making better offers. The median salary for workers in the US on an H-1B is about $25,000 less than a US citizen working a similar position in tech. While the data here is not completely unambiguous to position types or experience level, it certainly seems that there is a hire gap, especially when one considers that most workers with H-1B visas work in outsourcing companies, who sell labor to other companies (and are thus incentivized to provide workers for less than a regular hire). Even if the hiring was completely fair,sponsoring an H-1B visa osts an employer several thousand dollars in added fees, and there is economic incentive to raise that money by cutting other benefits.

To make matters worse, if the H-1B is actually intended to encourage skilled labor migration into the US, then it is currently being outdone by other systems. The H-1B traditionally lasts 3 years, with a stipulation to expand to 6, but isn’t permanent. A worker interested in living in the United States full time must apply for a Green Card. In addition to increasing the amount of paperwork needed to become a citizen, the wait time for Green Cards has expanded to the point someone interested in working in the United States could apply for an H-1B and a Green Card at the same time, work out their entire extended H-1B period and still have to wait several years until they will receive a Green Card (during which they are now unable to work in the US). To complicate matters further, workers on an H-1B visa cannot bring their families with them, their families must apply for H-4 nonimmigrant classifications, with narrower restrictions than the H-1B. Other nations, Canada in particular, due to its cultural similarity to the US, have adopted simpler systems with lower backlogs. An increasing number of workers are choosing to look elsewhere from the US either to avoid migratory hassle or after being forced to seek other options after waiting in long lines.

Stoics say that people should concern themselves with acting rationally in accordance with universal virtue, and therefore the issue of migration is fairly indifferent. If it makes sense for an individual or a family to migrate, then they should, if it doesn’t make sense, then they shouldn’t. Nations have a right to encourage labor more or less as it serves their principles. There are definitely extenuating circumstances to this policy, such as refugees, but in general acceptance of outsiders the pervue of 

However, when discussing the H-1B visa system in particular, we can examine its ethics in terms of the intent of the visa itself and by how the laws changing H-1B and H-1B  hires have maintained those intentions. 

As long as the H-1B visa system has a consistent intention and is honestly represented to it applicants, it is an ethical system. And the H-1B has a fairly consistent set of parameters: workers apply for the visa under the sponsorship of a prospective employer to receive the right to work in the US for 3 (extended to up to 6 years). After the H-1B is up, another can be applied for and under most circumstances is easier to secure the second time as it is not beholden to the initial H-1B issuance cap. Where problems have arisen with the terms of the H-1B is new legislation, which attempts to change quotas, or incentivize/disincentivize H-1B hires. Some of these changes have modified the promise of the H-1B and even changed the circumstances for current H-1B holders, which is certainly not consistent with the advertised intentions of the H-1B. The H-1B visa system at face value isn’t unethical, but changing the conditions H-1B on people who accepted the old conditions is.

The conundrum presented by the ethical issues is the H-1B debate is that the H1-B can’t really be made more ethical, all the problems arose out of the legal system that changes the rules and incentives surrounding H-1B visas. The guiding definition of “good” for stoicism is something that is good in all cases: and the changeability of the H-1B is provably not good in all cases. Therefor the H-1B visa system is not technically ethical. In fact, unless a visa system could guarantee certain rights to a holder once it is awarded, it cannot be totally ethical.



### Analysis of Gender Bias in Tech:
___

When it comes to gender issues in tech, stoicism is certainly having a moment. Many people are turning to this ethical framework to address key problems, specifically the belief that there are innate gender differences that account for different levels of ability, interests, preferences, or intelligence between men and women. To expand on this discrimination, a quote in Liza Mundy’s article for the Atlantic reads, “Women not only are hired in lower numbers than men are; they also leave tech at more than twice the rate men do… studies show that women who work in tech are interrupted in meetings more often than men. They are evaluated on their personality in a way that men are not. They are less likely to get funding from venture capitalists…And in a particularly cruel irony, women’s contributions to open-source software are accepted more often than men’s are, but only if their gender is unknown.” As if blatant bias and misrepresentation wasn’t enough, women are consistently judged, even by themselves, as lacking the “genius” trait that define the stereotypical male tech guru, and by consequence don’t consider a role in the industry or aren’t considered by others for more technical roles.

However, research on gender differences is often interpreted incorrectly. In many cases, the societal shaping, pressures, environment and unconscious bias is not incorporated into explaining studies. One thing research does conclude is that there is no hardwired difference between men and women. Instead, these differences arise from the societal boundaries that have historically defined gender. So far, the industry’s answer to gender issues has been understanding and identifying bias.

Unconscious-bias training is based on the idea that everyone holds natural biases. The key is to be aware of the bias and actively fight against it. Experts are also recommending changing the structure of a company or system. By implementing a set of requirements and procedures that change the way historically biased operations are carried out, like hiring, promoting, and idea generating, companies can prevent people from acting on their bias in the first place. 

Stoicism would offer a different solution, one that would require society to change its behavior and perception of women in tech. Stoicism emphasizes that all people have the same capacity for virtue and the same ability to achieve virtue, regardless of their circumstances. For the Stoics, recognizing equality as humans is a necessity to live virtuously and attain the ultimate goal of happiness.  A major component of virtue is serving other human beings and recognizing people’s common humanity. It was the Stoics who encouraged people to not define themselves or others by location, class, gender, or religion. The only true way to live in agreement with nature is to focus on what makes people similar and form a world community that goes beyond local differences.

Stoicism focuses on what one can control, so focusing on actions rather on the outcome is necessary. With this comes the idea that Stoics are ultimately responsible for what they do—they focus on deliberate and rational actions. By not acting or failing to change a system or environment that is oppressive to others, people cannot attain the ultimate goal—so gender bias has no place in this ethical framework.
