### Summaries
Computer-Assisted Warfare
---
Stoics would support computer-assisted warfare based on how prominent Stoics felt about war in general. Traditional Stoics believe that anger and fear should be avoided and are irrational feelings. Historically, this has been applied to war to mean that soldiers should not act based on their feelings of fear or anger, but humans often struggle to maintain this rigorous discipline under the stress of battle. Computer-assisted warfare that can make decisions without taking these emotions into account would adhere to Stoicism best. Stoics would support either human soldiers or robots carrying out orders as computers free of emotion decided what to do. 

Stoics emphasis on justice would also lead them to support most forms of computer-assisted warfare, though they would have the same reservations about completely automated robots and using robots in a "scorched earth" fashion that the article mentions. Overall, computer-assisted warfare seems more just than human-only warfare. Robots and real-time processing algorithms could make more accurate and faster observations and judgments in the field, which would help soldiers differentiate between civilians and intended targets, aim weapons more accurately, and overall help armies execute their goals more accurately. This increased ability could prevent innocent or accidental death and lead to battles being more effective, which could potentially shorten conflicts. Of course, computer-assisted warfare is only more just if the generals and soldiers already want to fight in a just manner, but that is true of all objects of war, such as weapons, fighter jets, and bombs. Computer-assisted warfare cannot guarantee that war is more just, but it can help armies fighting justly to fight as they intend, so Stoics would support its developoment and would take advantage of this technology.
