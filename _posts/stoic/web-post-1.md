### Stoicism's Statement of Purpose:
___
_What makes an action ethical according to Stoicism?_

An ethical action according to the Stoic Ethics framework is an action taken with rational thinking. A rational action is free of passion, as passion is damaging to the soul. To achieve this action, one must find a way for reason to overrule raw emotion. This can be done with virtue, virtue is believed to be the only thing in this world that always contributes to happiness. Unlike plants and animals, which are motivated by self-love of their physical bodies (appropriation), Stoics believe that humans are motivated by self-love of their rationality. This rationality not only accounts for an appreciation of one’s self and family, but for the human race as whole. The corruption of reason is the only thing in this world that always leads to misery. Vice causes a corruption of reason. Everything besides virtue and vice are indifferents.

_What triggers the need to evaluate how ethical an action is?_

Stoics believe that the best possible world for humans is a world of happiness. The key to achieving this world of happiness is by living in agreement with nature. They believe that there is no luck, but rather an ordered and rational sequence of events that is supposed to happen. Everyone has a fate, or a role to play in the attempt for a perfectly rational world. The only way to create a world of flourishing is by everyone performing an ethical action at every step of the way, as willed by Zeus. This triggers the need to evaluate just how ethical an action is, as there will always be a right answer. The framework to make the right decision will always be reason.

_What is the predisposition must have to act ethically in Stoicism?_

The predisposition that people have to act ethically according to the Stoic Ethics framework is humans’ views of themselves not only as physical bodies, but also their rationality. Plants take care of themselves by growing, taking in nutrition, and producing offspring. Animals are more complex as they can desire for something, have more senses and abilities, and care for their offspring. The only truly unique quality that humans have is the ability to reason. This sense of rationality is necessary to live with virtue and live an ethical life, therefore living in agreement with nature. Plants, animals, and humans have different criteria for living with nature. A human’s sense of self is his mental abilities in relation to his body. Rationality intrinsically has a social aspect to it, as one being with reason recognizes other beings with reason, and is therefore ethically obligated to treat them accordingly.

_What are three issues in Computer Technology that Stoicism might have a lot to say about?_

1. One ethical issue in computer technology is deciding how much security protection is enough for any given project. An increase in security means an increase in time it takes to develop the product. A Stoic would recognize that developers have a professional responsibility to provide a well-protected product. I imagine the Stoic would prefer the side of extra caution as an insecure product does the company much more harm than a slower-developed product. Additionally, if the product is going to the general public, the developers have a social responsibility to ensure safety.

2. Another ethical issue is how much privacy should individuals be granted online. To what extent should employers be secretly monitoring the accounts of its employees. A Stoic would point out that individuals deserve at least some modicum of privacy, but also realize that employers must keep their company safe. A Stoic might propose that employers be allowed to monitor employee accounts directly related to the company, but also inform the employees of this possible monitoring. An employee’s private accounts should be respected. As people with reason, the well-being of employees should be more important than the slightly increasing company success.

3. Another issue that a Stoic may weigh in on is deciding when to fix a minor bug instead of working on bigger future features. This is important because the order in which developers choose what to work on directly impacts paying customers. A Stoic would believe that the developer has a professional responsibility to give users the best experience possible. This issue is difficult, as it is tough to speak for the customers as to which choice is more desirable. I believe a Stoic would probably lean towards developing better features first, to provide users with the best overall experience in the long run.

### Stoicism and the IEEE Code of Ethics:
___

Stoics believe that professional work and conduct is “indifferent”, not good or evil on its own. The nature in which one makes decisions and works determines if an action is virtuous. Therefore, the IEEE Code of Ethics generally agrees with Stoicism as it lists rules for how to make professional work virtuous.

Stoicism breaks down virtue into four subdivisions: wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation. How to behave professionally with all of the traits is evident throughout the IEEE Code of Ethics. For example, the third rule explicitly mentions being honest and mandates one to be “realistic in stating claims or estimates.” The sixth rule says “to undertake technological tasks for other only if qualified,” which is very rational. Volunteering to act only within your ability is wise. The seventh rule directs one to give and ask for honest criticism of technical work. To accept criticism requires modesty, which is part of moderation as Stoicism defines it. The eighth rule states that one should “treat fairly all persons” and not discriminate, which is just.

The main contrast between Stoicism and the IEEE Code of Ethics is that Stoics only rely on reason to decide the virtuous way to live. The IEEE Code of Ethics sometimes states one should act in ways that may not always be the most rational. For example, the tenth rule says that one should assist others in professional development. Assisting others’ careers does not necessarily represent the most wise, just, courageous, or moderate use of time. The rational benefits of performing an action may not be clear, so a Stoic would not do it if trying to live virtuously.

Stoics want to live virtuously because they believe it is the only way to achieve happiness. The IEEE Code lacks any focus on the benefit of following these standards. Stoicism could add to this code of ethics by giving it more of a purpose. For example, a phrase saying that following this code of ethics and behaving virtuously will lead to happiness in one’s professional life.

### Stoicism and the ACM code of ethics:
___

Stoicism focuses on vices and virtues of humanity for part of its definition.  To be virtuous, Stoics believe that basing all things in life on perfected reason to be the height of achievement.  Perfected reason says that one should be freed from all passion, letting reason dictate all actions.  The last section of the ACM code, “Compliance with the Code”, follows perfected reasoning. All members are to uphold and promote the principles of the Code, and if anyone violates the Code, those actions will be treated as inconsistent with the Code and ACM membership and may result in ACM membership termination - the only reasonable outcome when a member pledges to follow the code. Additionally, following the four main virtues, the ACM strives to uphold those throughout its first section “General Moral Imperatives” by highlighting resourcefulness, honesty, diligence, and decency, to name a few.

Stoicism and the ACM Code of Ethics however differs greatly overall.  Stoicism is driven by the pursuit of happiness achieved through virtue. However, the Stoic Theory of Appropriation describes anything that doesn’t subscribe to the notion of “vice” or “virtue” is indifferent.  The ACM Code of Ethics, particularly sections two and three would generally be considered indifferents and therefore wouldn’t truly contribute to a Stoic’s desire for virtue.  “Improving public understanding of computing and its consequences” from section two and “Articulate social responsibilities of members and encourage their acceptance of those responsibilities” from section three are merely two such examples of indifferent policies.  

The desire to achieve happiness by living virtuously is the overall goal of Stoicism.  The Association for Computing Machinery Code of Ethics completely avoids any language on the outcome of proper membership.  Stoics can experience good feelings, as long as they are tempered, but it appears as if those in the ACM do not have the ability to enjoy or take pride in their work as defined by its Code.  Adding these details to the ACM Code would be powerful and influential for any member diligently following the Code.

### Stoicism and the ICCP Code of Ethics:
___

Stoics uphold reason as the greatest form of excellence in existence. They also uphold that rational thinking and the fulfillment of an ethos based on reason is accomplished through virtue. Actions that are in alignment with virtue, and therefore with reason, produce happiness as a direct result. The ICCP Code of Ethics is in many ways synergetic with Stoicism. Following this code of ethics requires those certified by this organization to act in the name of particular virtues. Professionalism, commitment to continuing education and maintaining a high standard of skill and knowledge, honesty, competence, integrity, and consequences for failing to fulfill these virtues are at the heart of this code of ethics. Acting in accordance with these virtues both brings reason - and reasonable paths to happiness - to members of the ICCP and those they impact in their professional lives. Furthermore, these virtues outlined in the ICCP Code of Ethics work well with the four categories outlined in Stoicism: wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation.

The ICCP Code of Ethics is organized in such a way that each subheading announces a virtue to which the following language pertains. Thus, there are not very many dissimilarities between the ICCP Code of Ethics and the Stoicism ethos. However, one particular area that might be considered to deviate from Stoicism is the code pertaining to fostering more public knowledge of computing systems and knowledge of the field by the general public. This does not explicitly pertain to virtue or vice, and therefore a Stoic would consider this part of the code of ethics to be indifferent and of no importance.

Much like the ACM and IEEE Codes of Ethics, the ICCP Code of ethics does not contain any language describing the outcome of proper adherence to it. Rather, it only describes consequences for failing to uphold the code. Insertion of a more Stoic ethos into this code of ethics would indicate the results of proper adherence; namely, the resulting happiness that flows from virtuous actions. This can act as a powerful motivator for those certified by the ICCP to understand the rationality of abiding by the code, as opposed to merely being motivated by fear of the removal of such certification for professionally failing to uphold the code.
