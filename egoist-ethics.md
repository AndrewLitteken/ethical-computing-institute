## “The good of any one individual is of no more importance, from the point of view (if I may so say) of the Universe, than the good of any other; unless, that is, there are special grounds for believing that more good is likely to be realized in the one case than in the other.”
### ― Henry Sidgwick, *The Methods of Ethics*

## Statement of Purpose
#### What makes an action ethical?

  The basic theory of egoist ethics is that one’s self is, or should be, the motivation and goal of one’s actions. Egoism has three main forms, psychological, ethical, and rational. For our purposes, the crucial form is ethical, as the other two make claims outside the boundaries of morality. Psychological egoism argues that every action an actor makes necessarily contributes to self-interest, and rational egoism claims that every rational action must be in an actor’s self-interest. Ethical egoism, however, is a consequential ethical framework. Under it, an action is ethical if and only if the result of that action maximizes the self interest of the actor. 

#### What triggers the need to evaluate an action?
  As mentioned earlier, ethical egoism is consequentialist. As a result, all actions are measured by the consequences of their actions. Thus, in terms of ethical egoism, actions are evaluated as ethical or not after the action has occurred. If an action results in the maximization of self interest for the individual actor it is ethical. In this case, intent does not matter, and neither does the result of the action on other people, unless those people contribute to the self interest of the actor. For example, someone who almost gets caught stealing a generous sum of money from someone else, but is not caught, has, according to ethical egoism, acted ethically. Despite the fact that the victim loses their money and the actor almost got caught, intentions and consequences upon someone else are irrelevant to ethical egoists. This person acted in their own self-interest, and as long as they face no long term consequences or psychological issues, they have acted ethically.


#### Predisposition to act in accordance to Deontological ethics
  Many would argue that in our capitalistic society, most people are prone to prescribing to egoist actions. This is the thought between psychological and rational egoism, which both proclaim that people have predispositions towards egoistic behavior. In particular, psychological egoism argues that every action a human being ever takes must be in their self-interest or they would never do it. According to this framework, even things that we would often consider selfless, such as charity or sacrifice, are done because of self-interest: maybe the actor wanted fame, acclaim, or a feeling of accomplishment. Rational egoism does not make a bold claim regarding “every action.” Instead, it argues that the only rational decisions that people make are the ones in their self-interest. Any other decision is necessarily irrational. Thus, exorbitant sacrifice would be considered irrational, but possible, under this framework.

#### Three issues in computer technology
Issue #1: Affirmative Action in Technology.
Say, in this hypothetical, that the person we are talking about is a white male in technology. Using ethical egoism as our ethical foundation for this, the actor would be firmly against the implementation or maintenance of affirmative action in technology. Given that ethical egoism demands actions that have the consequence of maximizing self-interest, white men in technology would be acting ethically if they fought against affirmative action policies. These policies, while vastly beneficial towards creating equity in technology and lifting up marginalized voices, also result in the leveling of the playing field and thus harming the success of some white men. Since ethical egoism is consequentialist, the consequences of affirmative action would prove to be unethical for a white male.  

Issue #2: Plagiarism
Consider a scenario where a developer is working under a tight deadline on an area of computer science that is not necessarily well documented or thoroughly explored.  The developer finds code on the internet that solves all of their current problems.  From an egoist perspective, it would be perfectly ethical for the developer to copy and paste the code without citing it or giving the proper credit to the original creator.  Plagiarism such as this harms creator of the original code, but it benefits the developer who copy-pasted it.  Although most ethical frameworks would consider this action to be unethical and, unless the code was open source, would most likely be considered illegal.  However, the egoist ethical framework has no problem with a developer stealing the intellectual property of someone else because it benefits the developer.

Issue #3: Whistleblowing
For example, in a scenario where a company is doing something illegal, an employee could choose to not disclose it to the proper authorities and continue to let it happen. This would be within the guidelines of an egoist ethical framework because it would not be in that employee’s best interest to expose that information. Say that they are working for the government. Then, leaking this information would be illegal, and they could face serious legal repercussions and end up incarcerated. Therefore, this definitely would not in the best self-interest of the employee.

### IEEE Code of Ethics:
####Briefly summarize the similarities between the code of ethics and your ethical framework. 
The main similarity between the IEEE code of ethics and egoist ethics deals with point 6, which calls on people to “maintain and improve [their] technical competence”.  Doing so is quite obviously beneficial to the self and so aligns with egoist philosophies.  Another similarity between the two is in point 7, which talks about seeking and accepting honest criticism.  Honest criticism has a focus of self-improvement and someone seeking out criticism has an opportunity to benefit themselves by learning from their mistakes.

####Briefly summarize the differences between the code of ethics and your ethical framework.
The areas in which the IEEE code of ethics differs from the egoist framework are those which deal with the protection, education, and fair treatment of others, most notable in points 1, 5, 8, 9, and 10.  According to the egoist ethical framework, one should do what is in their own self interest.  This says nothing about the well-being or interests of others.  So, while the points listed above do not directly contradict with the egoist framework, they would be of no concern to an egoist as they say nothing about whether they promote the interests of the egoist themself. 

####State something that is missing from the code of ethics which your ethical framework can provide.
What the IEEE code of ethics is missing is a purpose or motivation for the ethical decisions made by one following the code.  While not all points of the IEEE code of ethics align with the egoist ethical framework (as explained above), egoist ethics can give a purpose to the areas in which egoist ethics apply.  In the egoist ethical framework, all ethical actions have a purpose, namely to benefit oneself.  If the IEEE code had a purpose behind them, it can guide people on the way to act in a situation in which the code of ethics cannot provide guidance or is ambiguous.  Although the IEEE code of ethics need not have the purpose of self-promotion as egoist ethics has, it can still benefit from a greater meaning that motivates the principles of the code of ethics.

### ACM Code:
####Briefly summarize the similarities between the code of ethics and your ethical framework. 
The ACM code of ethics gives some guidelines to the individual, such as telling them to be honest and trustworthy. This aligns with an egoist ethical framework because it is usually is in one’s best interest to be honest and disclose any mistakes in the present in order to maintain trustworthiness with other professionals in the future. That said, if a bug is discovered by someone and he does not think anyone will notice it, he could choose to not disclose it. This would be in line with an egoist ethical framework because if it will not affect him in the future, it is not in his best interest to spend the extra time fixing the bug. 

####Briefly summarize the differences between the code of ethics and your ethical framework.
The ACM code of ethics discusses the consequences of certain actions that affect other people and society in general, which is not taken into account in egoist ethics. The very first point made in the ACM code of ethics is that members must contribute to society and avoid doing harm to others. From the perspective of an egoist ethics framework, one does not have to worry about other people and should focus on maximizing their own self-interest. In the ACM code of ethics there is also a focus on educating the public and participating in outreach initiatives. Again, these are not relevant to egoist ethics unless these activities somehow aligned with an individual maximizing their own self-interest.

####State something that is missing from the code of ethics which your ethical framework can provide.
The ACM code of ethics does not say anything about any sort of ethical hacking. It says that under no circumstance should one enter a system, software, or files without explicit permission. An egoist ethical framework could provide some helpful guidelines on this. For example, say there is a malicious system that is attacking your software. Hacking into and stopping that system would be in line with egoist ethics because it would be in your best interest to stop it.

### ICCP:
####Briefly summarize the similarities between the code of ethics and your ethical framework. 
Some of the statements in the ICCP are largely in agreement with egoist ethics; for example, section 3.1 recommends that members should continue their education in their fields of study. Continued education is likely a good investment for even the most self-interested members due to its ability to increase job performance. Also, while section 2.7 on accountability may not seem to be done primarily out of self-interest, a lack of accountability my negatively affect the judgements of one’s coworkers, and hamper attempts at promotion. Furthermore, by not being accountable for the quality of one’s work, clients may receive a poorly developed product, making them less likely to continue the professional relationship. Thus, being accountable on the job is in accordance with the egoist ethical framework. 


####Briefly summarize the differences between the code of ethics and your ethical framework.
Section 2.2 of the ICCP code of ethics notes that the members are expected to act with a sense of ‘Social Responsibility,’ meaning that they should act to improve ‘public safety’ and try to educate the general public about their professional field. Actions such as these are not encouraged by the egoist ethics unless they are done in self-interest as well, so this section represents a significant departure from what would be encouraged. Section 2.5 of the code states that members should not claim falsely claim competence that is not possessed. However, egoist ethics would likely allow for one to lie about competence if it caused a direct benefit to the liar. For example, lying during a job interview to increase the chance of getting the job would be considered acceptable. 

####State something that is missing from the code of ethics which your ethical framework can provide.
While the code of ethics may not make any comments about general self-interested business decisions, the egoist framework does. For example, if an employee is being told to frequently work overtime while being paid under market value, then it may seem reasonable for the employee to seek out an employer that would treat them more fairly. The code of ethics makes not comment on this, while the egoist framework would label this move as ethically correct.
