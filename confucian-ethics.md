## “If you try to guide the common people with coercive regulations and keep them in line with punishments, the common people will become evasive and will have no sense of shame. If, however, you guide them with Virtue, and keep them in line by means of ritual, the people will have a sense of shame and will rectify themselves.”
### ― Confucius, *The Analects*

# _Confucian Ethics_
### __Purpose__
Confucian Ethics emphasize a focus on the relationships between human beings. It is an ethics of virtue that believes in the importance defining virtues and principles in relation to one another. Through Confucian Ethics, it is believed that one achieves the fullest personhood by marking their relationships with mutual care and respect. In summary, Confucianism is based entirely on kindness, mutual respect, and an appreciation for character virtues. It is founded on the belief that a society can only find success when people learn to interact positively with one another. Based on this short summary, an action would be considered ethical through the lens of Confucian Ethics if it focused on positively impacting the relationship between individuals involved with both parties acting with kindness and a mutual respect for one another. For example, if an employee were to make a mistake while working on a project the response for their boss would not be one of anger resulting in punishment. In order to align with Confucian Ethics, the boss would help their employee understand the problem and how to fix it without the need for punishment, as this would have a negative impact on their established relationship.
### __Are ethics necessary?__
The social philosophy of Confucianism is based in acting with ren, or compassion in relation to others. This in and of itself shows the predisposition to act ethically, specifically in relation to other human beings, as the very basis of their belief system. This is further represented by the Golden Rule of Confucianism: “What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others”. Confucius argues that humans are responsible for their own actions and especially for their treatment of others. In addition to this, one of the core concepts of Confucianism is that of the relationship between junzi and dao. Junzi represents someone who is of “ethical nobility” or the ideal virtuous and ethical person. A way in which a person can attain this ethical nobility is to follow the dao, or the way human beings should live their lives.  
In conclusion, those who follow Confucianism are predisposed to act ethically for two main reasons: they understand the importance of relationships with others and social order so Confucianists will act ethically in relation to other humans in order to keep this social order in balance. Additionally, the core concept of the relationship between junzi and dao give Confucianists a more direct way of leading an ethical life in order to become a person of ethical nobility. “The junzi is the ethical exemplar with the virtues making it possible to follow the dao.” (from https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-chinese/#VirEthDaoJunRen)
### __Human Computer Interaction & AI__
A large focus of Confucian ethics is on human relationships and using virtue as a guide in these. In response to this, this ethical framework would likely focus largely on the various aspects of computer technology that affect how humans interact and form relationships, both in good and bad ways. This can appear in various ways, from the ease of global communication, to the ability to act anonymously, and further to the idea how virtue can connect with artificial intelligence. One impact that would likely be a polarizing topic is simply how humans are able to communicate with one another. Computer technology has allowed people to stay in touch with friends and family all over the globe. We are able to see and share in happy and sad moments from across the country, which allows relationships to foster mutual care and respect, even when not in close proximity. On the other hand, computer technology has changed how humans interact and form relationships in regular life. It can act as a distraction and prevent a caring relationship from being formed, and while it may not directly cause one to act without virtue, it may inhibit them from living out their life to the degree they should, as the concept of dao states. In a more direct opposition, the anonymity of the internet has led to people acting with no compassion for others, and created a platform for expression that directly opposes Confucian beliefs. On a different note, another concept that Confucian ethics would likely consider would be the advancement of artificial intelligence, and how virtue and relationships are changed or implemented when a non-human thing is present. While it is likely that the approach would remain largely unchanged, questions would be raised over whether artificial intelligence can participate in mutual care and compassion with a human.
### __Confucian Ethics & IEEE__
##### *Similarities*
Both the IEEE code of ethics and the Confucian Ethics appear to be a collection of values which are held to be aspirational rather than consequences of a single unifying principle. Furthermore, both the IEEE code of ethics and the Confucian Ethics are very concerned with an individual's relationships with those around them; the IEEE code of ethics has parts about how to act in relation to colleagues, customers, and the public at large that are all slightly different. Lastly, both the IEEE code of ethics and the Confucian Ethics are flexible with regard to people all being slightly different and having different needs and abilities. The IEEE code of ethics point 6 specifically acknowledges that one should act essentially to the best of their ability and the Confucian Ethics has different suggestions for different people such as whether or not to confront your elders when they are apparently wrong.
##### *Differences*
First, the IEEE code of ethics and the Confucian Ethics differ in how they inform one’s actions. Whereas, the Confucian Ethics consists of values that are aspirational and leaves it to the individual to decide how to act such that they have those values, the IEEE code of ethics explicitly describes what one should do. For example, the IEEE code of ethics explicitly says to reject bribery whereas the Confucian Ethics would suggest that to be honest is aspirational and leave it to the individual that, that includes rejecting bribery. Additionally, the IEEE code of ethics and the Confucian Ethics differ slightly in how the recommendations that they make about interacting with different people. The IEEE code of ethics states that one should not discriminate based on a host of attributes (point 8), which is to say that one should not change how one behaves with other people based on those attributes. It does not appear that the Confucian Ethics would agree with this approach since a core part of it is that one should have different values based on the person that they are interacting with. That is not to say that Confucian Ethics would necessarily result in one treating others worse based on those attributes but perhaps differently which the IEEE code of ethics condemns.
##### *Lessons*
The Confucian Ethics would add to the IEEE code of ethics by introducing at the least a reason for behaving in the way that it describes. That is the IEEE code of ethics provides no underlying reason for behaving in the way that it describes (perhaps because it is believed to be self evident) and that is something that the aspiriational values in the Confucian Ethics could provide.
### __Confucian Ethics & ACM__
##### *Similarities*
Both the ACM code of ethics and Confucian Ethics share a central theme of setting guidelines towards being virtuous person, both in personal life and daily work. The first code of ACM members is that they will “contribute to society and human well-being” and in Confucian Ethics the ideal of junzi embodies ethical nobility. With junzi comes respect for social forms of conduct and the ability to discern what is right in any situation. This same belief is consistent through the ACM code of ethics through codes such as, “be honest and trustworthy”, “honor confidentiality”, and “respect existing laws pertaining to professional work”.
##### *Differences*
The ACM is much more structured than Confucian Ethics. In Confucian Ethics correct behavior is defined through virtue. The virtue itself comes from Confucius's teachings on the ideals of junzi, dao, ren, and li, saying that when one strives to embody these virtues they reach a full state of ren, or “personal ethicalness”. The ACM structures itself in two ways, one by separating teachings between “code” and “guidelines” and two by separating the code of ethics into four sections with importance placed on specific members depending on the section. The “code” are statements intended to be followed by all members and embody the general beliefs of the ACM, as it’s not designed to frequently change. In ACM, these codes are present as much more direct statements of what to follow than the ideals of virtue presented in Confucian Ethics. The ACM also sets a framework for termination of membership when its principles are not upheld.
##### *Lessons*
Confucian Ethics could greatly add to the guidelines in the ACM code of ethics by introducing the notion of virtue as a reason for acting in an ethical way. For example, code 2.5 states to get full analysis, including risk, of your system to the public. The guideline goes on to give reasons such as “you’re in a position of public trust”. If there were emphasized through concepts like Dao then each code would have one overarching theme of virtue as guidance as well.
### __Confucian Ethics & ICCP__
##### *Similarities*
A major aspect of Confucian Ethics is the idea of having a life full relationships built on mutual care and respect. There are a few subsections in the ICCP Code of Ethics that directly relate to this. For example, the ICCP code stresses both accepting and providing reviews of your work and others work (2.4) and the creation of opportunities for people around you to learn and grow as professionals (3.5). Both of these tenets of ICCP would promote learning opportunities that allow the workers to better themselves and their skills, which is the same method that Confucian Ethics would take to address problems and build relationships. In addition, the ICCP ethics mention the importance of being honest and trustworthy (1.3) and being fair and not discriminating (1.4). Both of these are virtuous actions that would strengthen your relationships due to the respect it would show.
##### *Differences*
The ICCP code of ethics seem to put a strong emphasis on performing public good. In fact, the very first tenet it mentions (1.1) is “Contribute to society and human well-being.” It also mentions “foster public awareness” (2.7),  and “ensure that public good is the central concern” (3.1). While Confucian Ethics do have a major emphasis on acting virtuous, it doesn’t explicitly specify that it has to be for the public as opposed to how you carry yourself and your interactions with others.
##### *Lessons*
ICCP’s code makes references to the workplace, such as providing and receiving reviews and being a team member, but it doesn’t really talk about maintaining social order. Confucian ethics make mention of respecting the position of those around you and maintaining social order, so by adding a tenet into the ICCP code, then one could specify the importance of working in a team and respecting those around you, which fits in with the respect and trustworthiness already mentioned in 1.3.

###H-1B Visa System
#### *In Favor Of*
One of the most common arguments in favor of the H-1B system is that it brings the needed skill sets to America. It’s the idea that, if someone overseas is qualified and could really contribute to a project or team, then America should gladly bring them over to help better the product, team composition, etc. It’s written that “the program brings needed skills into the labor market, which helps firms remain innovative, productive, and competitive” (HBR). There’s also the fact that the technical fields are booming - “The number of young Americans graduating with qualifications in IT subjects is rising, but nowhere near fast enough to satisfy the burgeoning demand for their skills” (HBR). This implies that due to the shortage in the field, it’s in our best interest to seek out the talent we need, and if that comes from outside the USA, then to sponsor them so that we can get these talented individuals working on our products. Furthermore, bringing in people from foreign countries expands the viewpoints present on the team and in the workforce. They can bring all sorts of unique perspectives to problems and the workplace as they come from all sorts of ethic, cultural, socioeconomic, etc backgrounds compared to the current more white and male dominated tech workforce.
#### *In Opposition Of*
IEEE-USA posted an article explaining that the main reason they’re opposed to the H-1B visa system isn’t because they don’t want to bring talented people in, but because there are many companies (specifically outsourcing ones) that abuse the system to bring in talented workers and then not compensate them properly. They write, “It is a tool used by companies to avoid hiring American workers, and avoid paying American wages” (IEEE). They argue that the green card program is the one that’s fairer and should be expanded. It’s also a hard process for companies to obtain these visas (hard enough that “members of the tech industry have lobbied Congress to raise the cap on H-1B visas to help meet demand,” including Bill Gates in 2008 (HBR)). Meanwhile, about a third of the 85,000 visas went to 13 outsourcing companies. There have also been numerous studies done that show that the H-1B program has negative effects on American workers in general, including but not limited to displacement and lower earnings. It’s argued that this system brings cheaper foreign labor into America, and in doing so, “hurts American workers’ employment and income prospects” (HBR). Building off of those, Trump and his administration have placed further scrutiny on the program, signing an executive order titled “Buy American and Hire American” which, as you can guess, places an emphasis on prioritizing American products and workers.

#### *In response to the controversy*
Confucian Ethics frames itself around the three concepts: junzi, dao, and ren. Junzi refers to striving for ethical nobility through traits of virtue. Dao refers to the life path people should follow when they embody junzi. Ren then is the fulfilment of these concepts and describes that ethical excellence comes from living according to your personal dao by following junzi. An important caveat is that ren comes from the individual, rather than others, and that although dao is the guidelines for how humans should live, it also acknowledges that individuals have unique life paths. Junzi promotes harmony so it would largely be in favor of the service that H-1B provides. Confucian Ethics would empower employers to hire from outside their culture in order to encourage diverse ideas, promoting the growth of the company, and empower foreign workers to accept the best opportunity they can obtain in order to do what is best for their own life path. Confucian Ethics focus largely on improving the individual so any initiative that provides economic opportunity to individuals who wouldn’t have it otherwise would be seen as virtuous. However Confucian Ethics would also discourage the actions of outsourcing companies for how their choice to underpay their workers doesn’t follow junzi. Employers should treat their employees with the same respect as family because of how connected each worker’s dao is connected to one another, solely based on the amount of time humans spend working if nothing else. When H-1B works it empowers individuals to act in a way that betters their life. Companies gain diverse and developed skill sets, promoting the growth and well being of the company allowing it to have the means to provide the best service it can. Workers are given the means to provide for their families and drastically change their life situation. Even in the case of outsourcing companies who abuse this system, Confucian Ethics would still support the actions of the workers who accept these jobs because they do so to follow their own dao. The problem arises when these outsourcing companies place their workers in a position where they don’t have the means to meet a standard of living. While Confucianism embodies concern for oneself, it also claims this should be centered around a concern for everyone. When these outsourcing companies try to acquire as much cheap labor as possible in order to gain their own economic advantage they aren’t following junzi. Worse than hurting their own workers, they also steal opportunity from other workers applying for the H-1B visa that would otherwise be able to follow their dao. For this reason Confucian Ethics would support the IEEE’s stance to improve the green card process because it promotes the growth of junzi and dao that the H-1B visa provides by extending it to a wider group of people. Confucian Ethics doesn’t discriminate who can reach ren and better a society based on skill so providing opportunity to even the less-educated public would be an action of junzi. 

###Google Internal Memo
#### *Summary*
The Google internal memo discusses the author’s reasoning for why there exists a gender bias/gap at Google and in the tech industry as a whole. It is known that a male employee wrote the memo and he states that women are not underrepresented in tech because of an underlying bias and discrimination against them but because of inherent psychological differences between men and women. Essentially, he is arguing that there is no discrimination against women in tech, they just do not have the biological makings to succeed in the industry. He follows this argument up by stating “we need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism”, echoing his belief that the industry is not discriminatory. He also discusses the idea of moral bias as a category of bias that is not acknowledged at Google, but that deeply impacts the work atmosphere. He splits the biases into left and right political biases that impact the culture at Google. He acknowledges that neither side is 100% correct in their beliefs but that the left bias creates a politically correct culture in which dissenters are shamed into silence. This left bias is the reason, he argues, that many Google employees do not speak up about the gender gap not being caused by sexism. He states that other fellow employees share his same viewpoint but do not have the courage to share their thoughts thus creating an ideological echo chamber, which is the title of the memo.
#### *Validity*
One of the main aspects in the memo which Confucianism would find valid is where the author states that some of the diversity programs and classes that are meant to be more inclusive actually increase discrimination because they are only meant for some genders and races. In this way, Confucianism would say that the people implementing these programs should only do so if they would want them to be that way for everyone, in all circumstances. People should only take a certain action if that action is what they would want for the general population, not just a subset. 
In a similar manner, the author discusses how those who lean right often feel like they cannot share their opinions openly because they will face hostility from the left as a result. In the manner of Confucianism, in cases where this would be true, those on the left should only be hostile toward those on the right for sharing their opinions if they would also be okay with those on the right being hostile back at them. Otherwise, those at any point on the political spectrum should be receptive to other ideas and willing to discuss them if that is also what they would want for themselves. 
#### *Invalidity*
One main area where the memo would not be in line with Confucianism is where the author talks about men getting ahead in leadership roles more often than women because they are more dedicated to achieving status than women. This is a very individualistic approach to the topic, and regardless of its truth or lack thereof, Confucianism strongly emphasizes the family over the individual, and while this often refers to one’s actual blood-related family, it can also be interpreted to mean a company atmosphere and those who one works with in an industry. Following Confucianism, the focus would not be so much on increasing individual success alone, but to help others achieve similar success while achieving it individually at the same time. 

###Gender Bias in Tech
#### *Summary of Gender Issues*
As was discussed in the article “Why is Silicon Valley So Awful to Women?”, of all of the computing and mathematical jobs in the US, only about a quarter of those positions are held by women. They cited a few different reasons for what has caused this. We will discuss a few below: 
Undermining: Women often cite experiences with men doubting their abilities, diminishing their accomplishments and experience in the field, or interrupting then during a meeting as examples of undermining they have experienced. This leads to a gradual chipping away of women’s confidence and willingness to put their voice out there or even lead to women leaving tech altogether. 
Hostility: Many women also discuss sexist experiences and the effect this has on their workplace environment and willingness to stay in tech. In a completely male-dominated field, these issues are more prevalent and women are told they should develop “thicker skin.” A hostile work environment is not productive for anyone involved.
There are certainly more reasons for the disparity of men in tech versus women in tech (a lack of role models and superiors to look up to, for example) but this undermining and hostility are certainly two of the most cited examples for why women leave a career in tech or don’t even pursue a career in tech in the first place. 
#### *Response to Issues*
As is described in the article, The Issue of Gender Equality in Confucian Culture1, Confucianism places a large focus on looking at people as their position in a relationship, rather than as an individual person. So a woman is seen as a mother or a wife, not as a unique person. In this role, she is expected to act how a mother should, and care for and educate the family. For this reason, Confucianism has been seen to prolong stereotypical gender roles, and actually acts in certain ways to support the issues mentioned above. In response to the idea of women being undermined in the tech industry, Confucianism likely promotes beliefs that are somewhat in line with this. Leadership roles tend to be seen as being for men, and thus women in these roles may not be taken seriously. With the idea of hostility towards women in tech, Confucian beliefs would most likely oppose these ideas. While they do believe that people should act in the role of their relationship, they also believe that one should act with virtue. So hostility towards women would likely not be supported, but may be unintentionally provoked through the expected gender roles. For the same reason, Confucian beliefs are likely in line with the reason why there are fewer role models for women in tech than men, as the expected Confucian roles for women in society are not in line with these positions. 

###Ethnicity Bias in Tech
#### *Summary*
As discussed in the articles that we read and most notably in “Addressing Ethnic Diversity in Computer Science” the primary issue with regard to race in ethnicity in computer science is that minorities are very underrepresented and this is due to two phenomenons:
Stereotype: Typically harmful stereotypes in computer science prevent minorities from participating in computer science in two ways. First, stereotypes about who computer scientists are (such as that computer science is the realm of only men and only white and asian men at that) discourages people who do not meet that criteria from participating in computer science. That is, if someone does not see themselves in the stereotypical computer scientist then they will be less likely to pursue computer science and less likely to stick at it if the stereotype is proved to be true. Second, negative stereotypes about certain minority groups often lead people that belong to that group to believe that they are somehow especially unqualified or less qualified than their peers when it comes to computer science. This also leads to fewer people from minority groups pursuing computer science because it introduces self-doubt about one’s capability to pursue computer science. This aspect of stereotypes are also especially harmful in the sense that they are widely believed why among various minority groups there is a high rate of people who stop studying computer science. 
Isolation: This is related to stereotype and oftentimes works in tandem to dissuade people from minority groups from pursuing computer science but is slightly different. Isolation refers to the phenomenon that people from minority groups even if they earn a degree in computer science and find a job working in the field are often one of if not the only minority. This of course has the effect of creating the perception of hostility or lack of inclusiveness in their workplace or university which leads to fewer people from minority groups pursuing computer science. 
### *Response to Issues*
It is not immediately clear what Confucian ethics would say about the situation of a lack of diversity in computer science as the ethics does not say anything explicitly about this. However, there are two big things from the ethics that can be applied to this situation. First, Confucian ethics has a heavy emphasis on the relationships that people have with people around them so a Confucian would probably hold that individuals should make an attempt to make people from minority groups feel welcome in their workplace or university. Second, Confucian ethics also holds that often different advice should be given to different people based on their situation and in this vein a Confucian would probably hold that someone like a manager or someone who hires people holds a greater responsibility and requires different virtues to address this situation. For example, they may be required to be more diplomatic because they are expected by the nature of their position to resolve any conflicts that occur between the people that report to them.
