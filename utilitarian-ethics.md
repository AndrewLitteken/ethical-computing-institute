## “Create all the happiness you are able to create; remove all the misery you are able to remove. Every day will allow you, --will invite you to add something to the pleasure of others, --or to diminish something of their pains.”

### Utilitarianism Statement of *Purpose*

#### What makes an action ethical?
An action is ethical when it leads to the "best" end result possible based on that choice of action. "Best", in terms of Utilitarianism, is defined as bringing the most happiness and pleasure to the most people at the greatest intensity, proximity, and purity and for the longest duration. This happiness and pleasure can also be referred to as "utility", hence the name of this ethical framework. An ethical action considers the happiness of every person it could effect equally, not just the personal happiness of the doer.

#### What triggers the need to evaluate how ethical an action is?
Jeremy Bentham wrote utilitarian ethics with the intention to apply them toward social and legal reform. In this way, utilitarianism calls people to evaluate the utility of actions when writing laws or social codes of conduct. But in evaluating the utility, it is important to remember that only the end consequences of these laws should be considered in measuring how ethical it is -- not a given person's reaction to the law. Because different environmental and social circumstances could lead to different consequences, laws must be re-evaluated on their ethicalness frequently to adjust to changing times.

#### The predisposition people have to act ethically

A predisposition is the tendency to hold a particular attitude or act in a certain way. According to this definition, people may or may not have a predisposition to act ethically depending on whether they are a self-centered or more self-aware person. A more self-centered person might not have a predisposition because they are focused on the greatest pleasure for themselves, not necessarily the greatest number of people. However, a more self-aware person might always want to create the greatest good for the greatest number of people, and thus will be more predisposed to act 'ethically' according to the utilitarian framework.

#### Three issues in computing technology related to utilitarianism

Utilitarianism is a strong ethical framework to consider a variety of issues in computer technology. One of these is corporate ethical responsibility. For example, a company might build their products in such a way that many people benefit while a small number are harmed. Using the utilitarian calculus, the actions of the company are ethical. A specific example might be automation of factories and other miscellaneous jobs. For a particular company automating their factories, this might result in a cheaper product for millions of customers while harming those whose jobs were replaced. Using the utilitarian calculus, this is a very moral action.

A second example is government surveillance. Utilitarianism would have a lot to say about this with regards to whether mass surveillance brings the most happiness to the most number of people at the greatest intensity, proximity, purity, and for the longest duration. One might argue that government surveillance causes no perceived displeasure for the people who are surveilled while providing safety. Thus, it is very moral. However, one might say that government surveillance provides no perceived benefit to those who are surveilled while instead causing anxiety and unease.

A third example, related to government surveillance, is whistle-blowing. When someone like Edward Snowden releases documents related to the surveillance activity of the NSA, it brings into question an ethical dilemma that utilitarianism can weigh in on. While many people have different opinions on whether Snowden's actions were patriotism or betrayal, utilitarianism provides an interesting viewpoint by determining  whether greatest happiness was brought to the greatest number of people. Perhaps people finding out about government surveillance brought them displeasure, or perhaps more pleasure was created from people knowing the truth. It depends on interpretation and thus this is an interesting topic for this particular ethical framework.

### On the IEEE code of ethics

#### Similarities:
One thing that’s common between IEEE code of ethics and Utilitarianism is impartiality. IEEE code of ethics specifically states that members should treat everyone fairly and not discriminate against anyone. This statement follows the Utilitarian belief that everyone’s happiness should be weighted equally. Therefore, regardless of race, gender, and religion, every individual should be treated with respect and fairness.
IEEE also states that we should avoid damaging other people’s property or reputation in any sort of ways. It again reinforces the Utilitarian thinking that no one’s happiness is greater than anyone else’s and. Everyone’s happiness is of equal value.
Another common theme between IEEE code of ethics and Utilitarianism is maximizing the overall good. Utilitarianism emphasizes that we should strive to bring the greatest amount of good to the greatest number of individuals.  Similarly, IEEE code of ethics also stresses the importance of the safety, health, and welfare of the public. According to both, we should behave in ways that can benefit most people and refrain from behaviors that may cause harm to most people.

#### Differences:
IEEE code of ethics requires its members to “reject bribery in all its forms”. However, according to Utilitarian thinking, different forms of bribery can lead to different results and thus might be acceptable in certain conditions. Since whether an action is right is solely dependent on the consequence it brings and there is no direct correlation between bribery and the loss of happiness of all parties involved, Utilitarians might want to argue about the validity of this particular statement.

#### Something missing that Utilitarianism can provide:
Utilitarianism provides a clear instruction on judging what should and should not be done. We should do anything that maximizes the overall good for all people and stay away from the other ones. IEEE tells us to avoid conflict of interests if possible, but it fails to provide a solution if the conflict is unavoidable. Utilitarianism could provide a way to resolve conflicts when necessary (though it might not be the best way).


### On the ACM code of ethics

#### Similarities:
Many of the moral imperatives of the ACM Code of Ethics align with the Utilitarian framework. As it is stated in the first imperative, the ACM believes that professionals should "contribute to society and human well-being". This ideal is strongly related to Utilitarianism as it encourage professionals to use their abilities to improve society and people’s lives. Another strong resemblance to Utilitarianism can be seen in the second imperative, which states that professionals should “avoid harm to others”.  In other words, the ACM Code of Ethics, like Utilitarianism, sees ethical actions as producing happiness and minimizing pain.

#### Differences:
Although there aren’t direct contradictions between the ACM Code of Ethics and Utilitarianism, if the Utilitarian framework is applied to certain situations, it might result in a violation of the ACM Code of Ethics. For example, the ACM greatly values honoring privacy, confidentiality, copyrights and intellectual property. However, a Utilitarian might easily break one of these ideals if it were to maximize overall happiness. For instance, leaking a confidential document would be seen as a serious offense by the ACM, but for an Utilitarian it would be an ethical decision if the confidential information would benefit the general public.

#### Something missing that Utilitarianism can provide:
Utilitarianism can help complement and further expand on the ACM Code of Ethics. As for instance, ACM states that professionals should "contribute to society and human well-being". However, the code doesn't expand very much on how exactly this should be done and how professionals should have this imperative in mind when making decisions. The Utilitarian framework can provide a more structured definition on what contributing to society and human well-being really means (i.e. maximizing happiness). Although applying Utilitarianism to the ACM Code of Ethics may cause some contradictions, it can help expand on some moral imperatives and give more strict guidelines on how professionals should act.


### On the ICCP code of ethics
Note: using the old ICCP code, found [here](https://www.iccp.org/uploads/8/1/2/9/81293176/iccp_code_of_ethics.pdf).

#### Similarities:
The ICCP Code of Conduct and Code of Good Practice include many tenets which fall within Utilitarianism. These tenets include emphases on social responsibility, public education, and accountability, which coincide with Utilitarianism's focus on maximizing the greater good. The Code of Good Practice also includes public safety as a major tenet, which again represents the Utilitarian ideal of maximizing wellbeing for all.

Another way in which the ICCP Code of Conduct matches with Utilitarianism is impartiality. Like the IEEE Code of Ethics, ICCP stresses impartiality—avoiding conflicts of interest, maintaining honesty and integrity, and

#### Differences:
Like the ACM and IEEE codes, one of the main ways in which the ICCP code could contradict Utilitarianism is in its restrictions to honor privacy, confidentiality, and other social and professional norms. In general, Utilitarianism takes the view that the ends justify the means and that if an action that might generally be understood as "wrong" (e.g. lying, breaking a contract, taking bribes) leads to a good outcome, that action is ethical. The ICCP code generally rejects this idea, explicitly rejecting decisions which it determines are wrong, regardless of the outcome. In this spirit, the ICCP requires discretion, law-abidance, and protection of privacy.

#### Something missing that Utilitarianism can provide:
The ICCP Codes of Conduct and Good Practice outline certain types of conduct as either encouraged or disallowed, but many real-world decisions can be morally ambiguous when looked at through this sort of lens. For instance, choosing whether to disclose a non-critical bug in a piece of software does not directly concern the Code's discussion of public safety or social responsibility, so the Utilitarian principle of maximizing happiness can be used to make a decision.

In addition, the Code of Good Practice makes the broad claim that "computing professionals must ensure that their efforts are used to benefit humanity." While the ICCP does not define what constitutes a benefit to humanity, Utilitarianism can provide the framework with which to measure a benefit to humanity.

### A summary and response to the controversy surrounding H-1B visas
To gain a clear picture of the H-1B visa system, it is necessary to view its benefits and drawbacks both from the position of those who either hold or desire a visa and from that of employers who are in need of the skills that non-immigrant workers hold. Many of the facets of this system have conflicting merits between the two groups; that is, what is beneficial for the employer may harm the employee, or vice versa. This makes it particularly challenging to value the system as a whole unless a clear ethical framework is used to analyze it. Therefore, in this discussion, the arguments both in favor of and in opposition to the H-1B system will be discussed with respect to both employers and employees, concluding with an analysis of the system guided by the utilitarian ethical framework.

For employers, the most obvious benefit is that they can more easily hire the talent they need. Especially in advanced STEM fields, it can be difficult to find enough people who have the skillset required to satisfactorily complete a job or project. By expanding the applicant pool beyond US borders, there is a greater chance of finding someone who meets a company’s needs. This is not only an advantage to the company, but to the customers who enjoy the services they provide. For employees, many workers enjoy protections under the system. For example, if certain qualifications are met, employers are required to pay visa holders an equal or higher wage than that of US citizens. However, Americans need not worry that a foreign applicant could take their job, since employers are not allowed to displace an American worker within 90 days before or after filing for a visa, and must prove that they have exhausted their resources in searching for a citizen to fill the position. For employees, it is a way to get a foot in the door to pave the way for citizenship or a permanent position, or to acquire international work experience. Additionally, unlike green cards and other work authorizations, there are no quotas or limits set on the number of citizens from certain countries, which means that citizens from countries with a high number of aspiring migrants may have a better chance at acquiring an H-1B visa.

Despite these advantages, there are many flaws with the system. First, from an employee perspective, there are obstacles that make getting a job more difficult than it would be for a US citizen. For example, even if a prospective foreign employee already has a job offer in hand, the lottery puts him or her at odds with all others who have applied for the H-1B visa. Out of hundreds of thousands of applicants, only 85,000 are granted the visa each year. Another issue lies within the exempt status that is conferred upon many employees. If an employee is being paid over $60,000 per year, he or she is considered exempt from the protections that were discussed earlier. In fields and cities where wages are much higher than $60,000, this presents major wage inequality problems, and even raises questions of livability. Additionally, this visa is only a temporary work designation. For workers who desire a more permanent post, getting a green card is a separate process that also has its flaws as it relates to the H-1B system. For example, only a certain number of green cards can be granted to citizens of a given country. Since there is no such restriction for H-1B visas, Indians, for instance, hold a majority of all H-1B visas, but the country restriction prevents many of them from achieving this permanent work certification later on despite already holding a job in America. The distribution of visas among fields is also uneven. According to the IEEE article, a disproportionate number of visas go to outsourcing companies that barely qualify as requiring highly skilled workers, which severely limits the amount of tech talent that is able to be hired by other companies, especially in conjunction with the already restrictive lottery. 

From a Utilitarian standpoint, it is important to analyze the consequences of the system, rather than its intent, and then to determine the relative happiness of those impacted by them. The main result of issuing an H-1B visa is that an employer gains a skilled worker, and an employee secures a desired post. Taking into account that no Americans can legally be displaced, this should action should not cause pain to any American citizens, at least with respect to job loss. Therefore, simply in terms of acquiring desired employment, there is a net increase in happiness, thus making it utilitarianist approved. However, one could argue that the flaws cause pain to employers and employees alike. For example, employers must pay thousands of dollars in fees to take on this new worker, and the employee could be being paid an unfair wage. Despite these obstacles, however, the employee still chooses to hire the worker, and the employee still chooses to take the job, which implies that the happiness they get from this newfound employment outweighs any pain they endure in the process. Therefore, net happiness is still positive, meaning that the H-1B visa system passes the utilitarian test.


### A response to the Google internal memo
The Google internal memo describes the opinions of an internal, Google engineer. The author writes about how we as a society must stop assuming that a gender gap implies sexism; and, more generally, we must stop assuming that differences in employee representation imply discrimination. The author says that some of these gender differences can be attributed to inherent psychological and biological differences  between men and women. The author hopes that we as a society can have a discussion about some of these differences without shaming and generalizing the people that bring these issues up. The author continues the article by arguing that Google (and society) is often blind to harmful, and even discriminatory practice because, as a culture, people's’ biases (moral, political, or other biases) do not allow them to have a meaningful, open discussion about these issues. Then, the author discusses how our “culture of shaming” makes people afraid to voice their opinions if they do not fit in with the majority. The author concludes the memo by offering some suggestions to how Google should change: demoralize diversity, stop alienating political views, confront biases, stop restricting program to certain genders/races, have an open and honest conversation about diversity programs, focus on psychological safety not just diversity, de-emphasize empathy, and to be open about the science of human nature.

The Utilitarian framework is a consequentialist, ethical theory that prioritizes the most happiness for the most people. Since we are focused on consequences, the Utilitarian framework is mostly indifferent to many of the points in this article and the framework would have to analyze the consequences of some of the authors’ suggestions to form an opinion. One specific concept that the Utilitarian framework would agree with is about the author’s discussion of gender roles. The author says that feminism has made great progress of freeing women from the “female gender role”; but, society has more work to do to free men from the “male gender role” and allow them to be more “feminine”. The Utilitarian framework agrees with the concept that people should be free of their gender roles because it would, in theory, allow more people to be happy because they can act and behave how they desire and this will bring happiness to more people.

The Utilitarian framework would disagree with the author’s suggestion of “Prioritizing Intention”. The author argues that Googlers should not focus on microaggressions and other unintentional transgressions because it will eventually lead “authoritarian policies”. Instead, Googlers should prioritize the intentions behind a person’s actions. The author believes that this is important for a community’s psychological safety and open, honest discussion. A Utilitarian would disagree with the author that we should prioritize intentions over the consequences. A Utilitarian would argue that the morality of an action is based on their consequences. It does not matter to the Utilitarian if someone had good intentions and accidently produced a negative consequence; to the Utilitarian, the person still committed an immoral action.

### An analysis of gender bias issues in tech
Unfortunately, today’s tech space is filled with gender issues.  Women are constantly subject to differ treatment than men, which leads to some alarming statistics. Today, women only hold approximately one quarter of U.S. computing and mathematical jobs.  The percentage of female computer-and-information science majors is only 18 percent. (The Atlantic) There are many gender issues that play into these skewed statistics, but two key issues are: a misunderstanding of studies regarding gender, sexual harassment in the workplace.

People in positions of power often misunderstand gender studies (or simply only accept facts they want to).  This leads these people to believe they have some sort of rational justification for why gender issues arise in their area of work.  Sexual harassment is unfortunately very common in tech.  Males feel that they are allowed to harass women, as there are often no consequences.  Women feel they can not speak up, as doing so may lead to them losing their own jobs.  

Utilitarianism can be used as a valuable ethical framework to better understand how to solve these gender issues in the tech space.  In addressing the misunderstanding of studies, the Utilitarian would say that those who use these studies to justify their actions should spend more time reading and analyzing the studies in question.  The person may lose some happiness in doing this extra work, but the world would gain more happiness in doing so.  In gaining a deeper understanding of the study, the person will be able to better act upon the findings in the study and stop using falsehoods to justify his or her actions.

A Utilitarian would consider two people in the situation of sexual harassment in the workplace: the victim and the perpetrator.  A Utilitarian may have trouble giving a definitive answer on how the victim should act.  On one hand, if the victim calls out the perpetrator, the victim could lose his or her job.  This would lead to a tremendous amount of unhappiness, but in speaking up, the victim could be making the lives of other people who are also victims of the perpetrator much better.  If the victim does not speak up, the victim may keep his or her job, but will have to suffer the heinous act of sexual harassment.  A Utilitarian would tell the perpetrator to admit his or her actions, face the consequences, and receive help.  The perpetrator will lose happiness in the process, as fines or jail-time will likely be in the near future, but the victim(s) will gain a tremendous amount of happiness in knowing that justice is served.  Also, the perpetrator will eventually gain happiness, as they hopefully learn to be a better person.  A person who sexually harasses others lives a deplorable life.  In seeking help, this person can transition to someone with a much more healthy and fulfilling life.

### An analysis of race and ethnicity issues in tech
African-Americans are severely underrepresented in Silicon Valley, as roughly 16% of the US population is black, but less than 1% of major Silicon Valley employees are black, including Google and Facebook. It is also very difficult for minority students to enroll in computer science courses due to the fact that they are stereotypically mostly white, thus causing them a feeling of isolation or exclusion. For example, a Stanford grad Khalil Griffin felt uncomfortable in computing courses, but is now prepared to attend the ACM Diversity Conference. This is an example of how we can strive to eliminate this issue of diversity. Stanford is taking a big step by addressing this issue and donating $8,000 to the conference to boost its recognition. Also, many young adults who are not your typical white male experience struggles even when they are in Silicon Valley working. Hallie Lomax states that she heard multiple people say things along the lines of “I learned to code when I was 7”. She did not have those kinds of opportunities growing up as a child, so even though she is working at Google, there is still a lot of diversity struggle within the company. Google also didn't give engineers any incentives to teach at a majority black school in Howard University. They said it would hurt the engineer. Recently, a software engineer wrote a 10-page document against Google’s diversity initiatives, which has since gone viral. The author states that Google has created many discriminatory practices such as programs only for people with a certain race, special treatment for “diversity” candidates, and practices that lower the bar for said candidates. The author claims that these practices are based off false assumptions backed by biases, and can ultimately increase racial tensions. 

Obviously these statistics are alarming and the groups of people involved are unhappy with their representation in the technology industry. From the perspective of a Utilitarian thinker, we would want the most good for the most number of people. Thus, we would be upset with these issues in diversity, and would be proactive to try and encourage racial inclusion in tech. This is because it would make the most people happy. However, many might think that this would possibly make the majority folks upset because they will be less represented. But, in Utilitarianism we like to see as many different people happy, so we would push to include more African-Americans, Hispanics and many others in the technology and computer science industries.
